642228,"bringing coastal SUBsurface water SOLutions to the market","2015","2018","Coastal areas are the most productive and economically dominant regions of the world. The high water demand in these regions, however, puts tremendous pressure on their freshwater resources and ecosystems. This leads to problems like seasonal water shortage, saltwater intrusion, and disappearance of wetlands. 

Building on national, regional and European research and innovation programs, in the past five years, a set of innovative, practical concepts have been developed for protection, enlargement and utilization of freshwater resources in coastal areas. These subsurface water solutions (SWS) combine innovations in water well design and configuration, allowing for advanced groundwater management, and maximum control over freshwater resources. SWS have been successfully piloted by public-private partnerships. These full-scale pilots have demonstrated SWS capacity to support sustainable freshwater supply in coastal areas, energy reduction, food production, and financial savings.

SUBSOL targets a market breakthrough of SWS as robust answers to freshwater resources challenges in coastal areas, by demonstration, market replication, standardization and commercialisation. The route to market includes business cases, market scans and capacity building in selected regions in Europe (Mediterranean, Northwestern Europe) and worldwide (USA, Brazil, China, Vietnam). SUBSOL will share experiences and outcomes with stakeholder groups through an online platform, that will be linked to existing networks, including EIP on Water.

The SUBSOL consortium combines knowledge providers, technology SMEs, consultants, and end-users from across Europe. Our ambition is to introduce a new way of thinking in terms of water resources management, promoting the sustainable development of coastal areas worldwide. This will stimulate economic growth and will create market opportunities and jobs for the European industry and SMEs."
642494,"ECOLORO: Reuse of Waste Water from the Textile Industry","2015","2018","Constant extraction of increasingly scarce fresh water puts a vital demand on increasing water-use efficiency in all sectors. The ECWRTI project will demonstrate the EColoRO concept on full industrial scale in two locations in the European textile industry. 

The EColoRO concept uses electro-coagulation (EC) combined with flotation to remove pollutants, colorants and chemicals from waste water very effectively.  This unique feature enables using ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis membrane processes downstream in an optimized way. The key advantages are: 
- Total reuse of waste-water in textile industry reducing fresh-water intake by at least  75% 
- Low-cost and economically highly attractive 
- Very flexible, containerized and modular, easy scalable, low footprint, suitable for retro-fit, brownfield or greenfield application
- Low energy use, no use of chemicals or flocculants, producing concentrated waste streams with very high re-use potential
- Enabler for optimizing use of water, allowing for advanced energy and resource efficiency in the textile manufacturing processes

EC and the EColoRO concept are currently proven at TRL 6. The ECWRTI project will run for 35 months and will deliver technological proof at TRL 8, ready for commercial uptake. It will further deliver the materials, analysis and tools needed for rapid commercial roll-out.
The consortium consists of a focused and well-balanced team. The project is SME driven with EColoRO as coordinator and 6 partners from 3 EU member states with key know-how on waste water purification (VITO, EColoRO), textile technology and production (Inotex, Utexbel), electro-coagulation and engineering (Morselt),  process technology, open innovation and project support (ISPT) and EU wide market access in the textile sector (Euratex). An advisory board with stakeholders from textile, process industry and waste water sectors will provide guidance, critical feedback and dissemination support."

The BioLinX partners have leading roles in the bioeconomies of South West Netherlands and Flanders, the Nordic Countries and Northern Italy and in the lignocellulose, agro- and agro-waste feedstock sectors.  The partners are all pioneers of systematic innovation management and cluster acceleration practices and between them have leading roles in over 45 current or recent collaborative bioeconomy projects.    From this strong starting point they will select sixty or more FP7 and Horizon 2020 biobased projects from all stages of the value chain, form the BioLinX clusters and develop among them brokerage, collaborative innovation and business acceleration dynamics.  
Specific objectives are: 
1. Selecting and scouting more than 60 high potential bio-economy projects,
2. Developing a network of key regional bioeconomy clusters (i.e. RIS3 regions or equivalent) covering 3 geographical regions (north, central, south)
3. Analysing, clustering and focusing selected FP7 and H2020 projects as well as the network of RIS3 bio-economy regions,
4. Implementing  the Innovation Linking & Support Programme consisting of activities focusing on Brokerage and Innovation incubation, Business development, finance and funding, Identifying and sharing good practices and Advocacy, communication and dissemination."
653522,"Climate Resilient Cities and Infrastructures","2015","2018","With most of its population and capital goods concentrated in urban areas, cities are key to the European economy.  One of the major challenges cities face are more frequent  extreme weather events due to climate change.The current diversity of approaches and methods available for cities developing an adaptation strategy limits the comparability between cities of vulnerabilities, adaptation options, infrastructures, etc., and, as a result, the resilience capability. The lack of standardized information to prioritize and select appropriate adaptation options restricts the exchange of experiences between cities. 
The objective of RESIN is to provide standardised  methodologies for vulnerability assessments, performance evaluations of adaptation measures, and for decision support tools supporting the development of robust adaptation strategies tailored to the city. To this end, RESIN aims to create a common unifying framework that allows comparing strategies, results and identification of best practices by
• Creating an urban typology that characterises European cities based on different socio-economic and biophysical variables
• Delivering standardised methods for assessing climate change impacts, vulnerabilities, and risks; providing an inventory of adaptation measures and developing standardised  methods to assess the performance of such adaptation measures
• Collaborating closely with 4 ‘case cities’ for practical applicability and reproducibility, and with European Standardisation organisations to ensure a systematic (standardised) implementation
• Integrating findings in a coherent framework for the decision making process, with associated methods, tools and datasets

The consortium consists of 17 partners from 8 different European countries, experienced in urban resilience and climate change, and combining theory (knowledge institutes/universities) with practice (cities, consultancies, network organisation, standardisation institute)."
653748,"Culture And RISkmanagement in Man-made And Natural Disasters","2015","2018","As risks are not “objective” but socially and culturally constructed, disaster management which is aware, respects, and makes use of local cultural aspects will be not only more effective but, at the same time, also improve the community’s disaster coping capacities. CARISMAND is setting out to identify these factors, to explore existing gaps and opportunities for improvement of disaster policies and procedures, and to develop a comprehensive toolkit which will allow professional as well as voluntary disaster managers to adopt culturally-aware everyday practices. This goal will be achieved by approaching the links, and gaps, between disaster management, culture and risk perception from the broadest possible multi-disciplinary perspective and, simultaneously, developing a feedback-loop between disaster management stakeholders and citizens to establish, test, and refine proposed solutions for culturally-informed best practices in disaster management. Whilst experts from a variety of fields (in particular legal, IT, cognitive science, anthropology, psychology, sociology) will undertake a comprehensive collation of existing knowledge and structures, a number of Citizen Summits and Stakeholder Assemblies will be organised. Systematically, CARISMAND will use an approach that examines natural, man-made and technical disasters, placing at the centre of attention specific aspects that affect culturally informed risk perceptions, eg whether disasters are caused intentionally or not, the different “visibility” of hazards, and various time scales of disasters such as slow/fast onset and short- and long-term effects. By organising six Citizen Summits (two per disaster category per year in two separate locations) where such disaster risks are prevalent , and three Stakeholder Assemblies (one per year) where the results are discussed through a wide cross-sectional knowledge transfer between disaster managers from different locations as well as from different cultural backgrounds."
653811,"Citizen Interaction Technologies Yield Community Policing","2015","2018","Theories underlying community policing received new impetus with the recent advent of smartphones and social media and especially user-generated content (UGC) where citizens engage in closer interaction with their local community and law enforcement agency (LEA). The years 2010-2014 have seen a rapid upsurge of smartphone apps aimed at improving crime reporting and other forms of UGC and interaction associated with community policing. Yet these apps are characterised by a predominantly Anglo-Saxon approach with the largest number originating in the USA, a few in Canada, Australia and with the UK apparently the only major EU state where there has been some take-up of these technologies. CITYCoP sets out to find out why the EU appears to be lagging behind although Community Policing is nominally a policy which has been put into action in a number of EU countries. It then goes on to develop a solution including a new smartphone app and on-line portal which are capable of being deployed in any European city while still retaining “local flavour” and diversity. These ICT solutions will also be designed from scratch to be fully compliant with strict privacy and data protection laws. A training scheme, including use of serious games, will be developed to assist training of officers and citizens in use of the app and portal.  CITYCoP will benefit from a multi-disciplinary approach that will include the sociology of community policing as well as cognitive science perspectives of the citizen’s interaction with community and LEAs through technology.  The partners in CITYCoP build on long years of successful collaboration in EU projects dealing with UGC, smart surveillance and privacy (CONSENT, SMART, RESPECT) positioning CITYCoP solutions to achieve integration into smart city eco-systems. CITYCoP will pilot deployments of multi-lingual smartphone apps, portals and serious games training packages in Bucharest (Romania), Lisbon (Portugal), Florence (Italy), Sheffield (UK)."

Research Infrastructure on Consumer Health and Food Intake using E-science with Linked Data Sharing

There is growing interest in consumer health as related to food, behaviour and lifestyle determinants. However, data is fragmented, key information is lacking, and the resulting knowledge gap prohibits policy makers and companies to make effective public health nutrition strategies and reformulation of food products. Making “the healthy the easy choice” requires knowledge on the context of personal life style choices of EU-citizens. 
RICHFIELDS will design a world-class infrastructure for innovative research on healthy food choice, preparation and consumption of EU-citizens, closely linked to their behaviour and lifestyle. This unique RI will bridge the gap by linking the agri-food and nutrition-health domains and account for the regional and socio-economic diversity of the EU. The RI will be instrumental to produce a scientifically reliable, technically sound and socio-legally robust evidence-base that enables scientists to efficiently collect, unlock, connect and share research data of EU-citizens. 
Consumers are central to the design: they harbour crucial information, as they increasingly adopt mobile apps and tech-wear, get access to e-business data and even medical information. Collectively, such real-life-time data create new opportunities for research, by e.g., monitoring of food-behaviour providing personalized feedback.  For further testing, detailing and underpinning and theory-building,  interfaces will be created to distributed facilities for experimental research, e.g., virtual supermarkets. Further enrichment of data is achieved via interfaces with information systems for food and health.
The consumer-focus and the scientific evidence of RICHFIELDS will, via its services, be available to (a) EU-consumers and consumer platforms, (b) stakeholders along the food chain, and (c) policy actors in the agri-food and nutrition-health domain."
654513,"Unraveling the mechanobiology of tissue growth in native and tissue-engineered heart valves","2016","2018","The currently available heart valve prostheses do not consist of living tissue and, hence, they cannot grow, repair, and remodel in response to changing demands. This restricts the use of valve replacements in pediatric patients, since they need multiple reoperations to accommodate somatic growth. Tissue-engineered heart valves (TEHVs) may be able to overcome this limitation due to their growth and remodeling potential. However, the exact growth and remodeling processes remain poorly understood, which has become evident in many pre-clinical studies where TEHVs lost their functionality over time due to adverse tissue remodeling. 
The goal of this proposal is to unravel the mechanisms of tissue growth in native valves and TEHVs by integrating advanced continuum mechanics and cell biology, in order to develop predictive models of valve growth that can guide and optimize tissue engineering of heart valves. To achieve this goal, I will first be trained in developing continuum models of valve growth in the lab of Dr. Kuhl at Stanford University, who is a leading expert in modeling soft tissue growth. Furthermore, I will be trained in cell biology and mechanobiology which will enable me to develop agent-based mechanobiological models as a driving mechanism for valve growth in the continuum models.
I will use the obtained knowledge to analyze and predict growth of TEHVs in Europe. At this moment, mechanistic models of valve growth are not available. The models that I will develop during and after my training will provide crucial information for designing TEHVs with long-term functionality and growth potential, and will boost European excellence and competitiveness in the fields of biomechanics and tissue engineering. Moreover, the training that I will receive will significantly extend my scientific profile, and it will provide me the valuable international training at a prestigious academic institute that is required for pursuing an academic career in Europe."
655941,"Duality For Logic On Words","2016","2018","Duality For Logic on Words (DFLOW)

The mathematical theory of Stone duality underlies a deep connection between syntax and semantics in logic and theoretical computer science, and allows for powerful applications in both of these research fields. The aim of this project is to apply the topological methods provided by Stone duality to the study of the expressive power of logic in describing formal languages of both finite and infinite words. 

During the outgoing phase of the project, at the Mathematics Department at the City College of the City University of New York, the applicant will perform an in-depth study of profinite semigroups and their applications in formal language theory, through the lens of Stone duality and finite model theory. In particular, recent insights from duality theory will be applied to obtain tractable combinatorial descriptions of the free profinite objects for logic fragments of varying expressive power. 
During the return phase to Europe, to the Institute for Logic, Language and Computation at the University of Amsterdam, the applicability of duality theory will be extended to streams and data words. To this end, the knowledge and skills obtained during the outgoing phase will be combined with the existing local expertise on logic and coalgebra in Amsterdam.

During both phases, the hands-on research training will be complemented by training activities to further enhance the applicant's skills in networking, collaboration, teaching, communication and management.

The project, taking place at the interface of mathematics and computer science, has the potential to make a significant impact in three different ways: by advancing the research on Stone duality and formal language theory, by facilitating a new collaboration between the European host institute and a world-leading mathematics department in the USA, and by establishing the applicant's position as a leading young researcher in his field."
657750,"Sheep, Wool, Landscape and Connectivity","2016","2018","The purpose of the proposed Marie Sklodowska-Curie action is to enable Paolo Palladino, Professor of History and Theory in the Department of History at Lancaster University, to advance his scientific career by means of further training through research. The programme of research, which Luis Lobo-Guerrero, Professor of History and Theory of International Relations in the Faculty of Arts at the University of Groningen will supervise, and around which the action will develop, focuses on the processes involved in the evolution of three regional economies and the commodification of their agro-biological heritage, specifically as this relates to sheep and the production of woollen textiles (these regions are the Lake District and Dales of northern England, the Catalonian Pyrenees, and the Piedmontese Alps). A trans-national, comparative approach allows for investigation of the diversity of local responses to the transformation of agro-biological products into commodities traded on a global scale; an extended chronological perspective also allows for the investigation of the similarly complex relationship between the creation of bio-economic value and the passage of time (WP1, WP2 and WP3). The results of such investigation then serve as the basis for the development of an empirically grounded, critical understanding of socio-cultural structures and their transformation (WP4). The action thus allows Palladino to advance his understanding of research skills and methods at the intersection of historical, philosophical and sociological modes of inquiry. At the same time, the hosting organisation and beneficiary of the action, the Institute for the Study of Culture (ICOG) at the University of Groningen, will expand its programme of research on the political economy of global integration, on the importance of biological and ecological resources to such integration, and on the role of the past in the construction of a more sustainable future."
660426,"Prostate cancer extracellular vesicles as biomarkers for nanomedicine treatment","2015","2018","Prostate cancer (PC) is one of the deadliest types of cancer in males worldwide. Early stage PC is often curable but many patients develop castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), resulting in lethal end-stage disease. Prostate specific antigen (PSA) plasma levels have been traditionally exploited for diagnosis and prognosis. However, the application of PSA as a biomarker is associated with predictability issues. Advanced therapies are required for the treatment of CRPC, guided by a reliable companion diagnostic (CDx) test to monitor therapeutic efficacy. The aim of “PREVENT” is to co-develop a nanomedicine-based combination therapy for the treatment of CRPC and a CDx based on extracellular vesicles (EVs). I will employ tumour-targeted nanomedicines to deliver more drug to the tumour and reduce side effects when compared to free drug. The treatment comprises microfluidics-prepared lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) containing siRNAs that target genes involved in CRPC and LNPs loaded with the cytotoxic anti-cancer agent docetaxel to achieve synergistic therapeutic effects. For the CDx test, extracellular vesicles (EVs) have created excitement as possible biomarker candidates. EVs are released by cells as means of intercellular communication and can be detected in bodily fluids. The number of EVs and their composition is altered in CRPC, raising opportunities to exploit them in a CDx test. As EVs provide a fingerprint of their parental cell, EVs can be considered liquid biopsies, providing more information than standard biomarker measurements, and much less invasive than prostate biopsies. I will collect blood and urine samples during the preclinical evaluation of the proposed treatment for analysis using immunocapture and flow cytometry-based immunodetection platforms. The co-development of a nanomedicine combination treatment for CRPC and a CDx test is a rational strategy that has the potential to advance into clinical evaluation and ultimately improve patient survival."
662155,"An integrated pilot line for micro-fabricated medical devices","2015","2018","The goal of the InForMed project is to establish an integrated pilot line for medical devices. The pilot line includes micro-fabrication, assembly and even the fabrication of smart catheters. The heart of this chain is the micro-fabrication and assembly facility of Philips Innovation Services, which will be qualified for small/medium-scale production of medical devices. The pilot facility will be open to other users for pilot production and product validation. It is the aim of the pilot line: to safeguard and consolidate Europe’s strong position in “traditional” medical diagnostic equipment, to enable emerging markets - especially in smart minimally invasive instruments and point-of-care diagnostic equipment - and to stimulate the development of entirely new markets, by providing an industrial micro-fabrication and assembly facility where new materials can be processed and assembled. The pilot line will be integrated in a complete innovation value chain from technology concept to high-volume production and system qualification. Protocols will be developed to ensure an efficient technology transfer between the different links in the value chain. Six challenging demonstrators products will be realized that address societal challenges in: “Hospital and Heuristic Care” and “Home care and well-being,” and demonstrate the trend towards “Smart Health” solutions."

The main objective is the demonstration of the 7nm IC technology integration in line with the industry needs and the ITRS roadmap on real devices in the Advanced Patterning Center at imec using innovative device architecture and comprising demonstration of a lithographic platform for EUV and immersion technology, advanced process and holistic metrology platforms, new materials and mask infrastructure.
A lithography scanner will be developed based on EUV technology to achieve the 7nm module patterning specification. Metrology platforms need to be qualified for N7’s 1D, 2D and 3D geometries with the appropriate precision and accuracy. For the 7nm technology modules a large number of new materials will need to be introduced. The introduction of these new materials brings challenges for all involved processes and the related equipment set. Next to new deposition processes also the interaction of the involved materials with subsequent etch, clean and planarization steps will be studied. Major European stakeholders in EUV mask development will collaboratively work together on a number of key remaining EUV mask issues.
The first two years of the project will be dedicated to find the best options for patterning, device performance, and integration. In the last year a full N7 integration with electrical measurements will be performed to enable the validation of the 7nm process options for a High Volume Manufacturing.
The SeNaTe project relates to the ECSEL work program topic Process technologies – More Moore. It addresses and targets as set out in the MASP at the discovery of new Semiconductor Process, Equipment and Materials solutions for advanced CMOS processes that enable the nano-structuring of electronic devices with 7nm resolution in high-volume manufacturing and fast prototyping."

Bringing these stakeholders together with gender experts and teenagers themselves, Hypatia will develop, pilot and disseminate a unique modular toolkit of activities and guidelines for engaging teenagers in STEM in a gender-inclusive way. These innovative activities, based on existing European good practices, will be implemented in 14 EU countries and further afield, in schools, science museums and by institutions in research and industry, thanks to hubs of stakeholders strengthened through the project. The activities will have a central focus on gender-inclusive ways of communicating STEM, empowering teenage girls and exploring the range of skills that are needed for the great variety of STEM studies and careers open to young people. The Hypatia hubs will provide a sustainable basis for these activities to be carried out on the long term, with a focus on dissemination through networks and stakeholder engagement allowing the project impact to multiply."

PRINTEGER analyses the incidence and individual, social, and organisational causes and dynamics of misconduct. It also analyses how institutions respond to allegations, specifically in interaction with neighbouring law, the media, complex research organisations, and systemic changes in research. From the perspective of the research work floor, including the daily work of journal editors or research managers, PRINTEGER will analyse how current instruments of integrity policy operate in practice. How do guidelines most contribute to integrity? What other instruments and procedures will promote integrity?

PRINTEGER will provide concrete tools and advice to promote research integrity in Europe through four specific target groups:
• advice on an optimal policy mix and opportunities for harmonisation to research policy makers;
• best practice approaches to foster integrity for research leaders and managers;
• advice on the use of IT tools and organisational measures for research support organisations;
• practice-informed educational tools for ethical training and reflection of early career scientists.

666800,"Validation of PreCursor-M for enhanced Cervical (Pre)Cancer detection","2015","2018","With an estimated 528,000 new cases and 266,000 deaths in 2012, cervical cancer (CC) is the fourth most common type of cancer in women, and the seventh overall. CC is preventable with regular screening tests and follow-up, and curable if found and treated early. In many countries, screening programmes for cervical cancer are in place, which have resulted in a marked decrease in cervical cancer incidence. hrHPV DNA testing will replace cytology as primary screening test for CC, but its drawback as stand-alone CC screening test is its low specificity, causing overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Triage of hrHPV\ women is essential to maintain a sustainable screening programme. 
PreCursor-M (Self-screen B.V.) is a proprietary molecular assay to determine disease progression and severity based on the methylation level of 3 host-biomarkers.  Supplementing hrHPV DNA screening with PreCursor-M will provide information on the presence of infection, and the response by the host cells. This will allow identification of all women at risk for cervical cancer without overdiagnosis and overtreatment.
The methylation level of three molecular markers (CADM1, MAL and miR124-2) was shown to increase proportional to cervical cancer progression and severity. In Precursor-M, these markers have been combined in a multiplex methylation marker panel. The markers have been separately validated in clinical settings, and the combined marker panel has been validated in laboratory and small-scale clinical settings. VALID-SCREEN will complete the final step towards commercial success for PreCursor-M: clinical validation of PreCursor-M in well-characterised cohorts, from five clinical centres, in four EU countries, as a triage test to hrHPV screening for cervical cancer."

The aim is to transfer recent scientific findings in novel lignin dissolving DES to process concept level that can be evaluated against current pulping processes. The technological breakthrough expected through the development of such new DES pulping technology could reduce process energy intensity by at least 40% and investment costs by 50% compared to traditional chemical pulping technology. 
In parallel, the development of efficient novel cellulose-dissolving DES and other DESs to process lignocellulose materials, starting with paper for recycling, is aimed at with focus on sustainability in selecting DES chemical components and technical and economic applicability of the solvent system.
PROVIDES will create both fundamental and industry driven technological knowledge based on lab to bench/pilot scale experimentation, through: mapping and selection of most effective DES families; investigating processes and process technology options, including DES regeneration and recycling, in order to define full industrial processes that would isolate high quality cellulose/fibres, lignin and hemicelluloses; providing products for industrial evaluation; establishing technical data to evaluate industrial feasibility and integration; performing life-cycle oriented assessment of environmental and socio-economic performance; assessing impacts in terms of energy and cost reductions as well as new high added value applications PROVIDES could provide to the pulp and paper industry sector."
671564,"Computing Patterns for High Performance Multiscale Computing","2015","2018","Multiscale phenomena are ubiquitous and they are the key to understanding the complexity of our world. Despite the significant progress achieved through computer simulations over the last decades, we are still limited in our capability to accurately and reliably simulate hierarchies of interacting multiscale physical processes that span a wide range of time and length scales, thus quickly reaching the limits of contemporary high performance computing at the tera- and petascale. Exascale supercomputers promise to lift this limitation, and in this project we will develop multiscale computing algorithms capable of producing high-fidelity scientific results and scalable to exascale computing systems. Our main objective is to develop generic and reusable High Performance Multiscale Computing algorithms that will address the exascale challenges posed by heterogeneous architectures and will enable us to run multiscale applications with extreme data requirements while achieving scalability, robustness, resiliency, and energy efficiency. Our approach is based on generic multiscale computing patterns that allow us to implement customized algorithms to optimise load balancing, data handling, fault tolerance and energy consumption under generic exascale application scenarios. We will realise an experimental execution environment on our pan-European facility, which will be used to measure performance characteristics and develop models that can provide reliable performance predictions for emerging and future exascale architectures. The viability of our approach will be demonstrated by implementing nine grand challenge applications which are exascale-ready and pave the road to unprecedented scientific discoveries. Our ambition is to establish new standards for multiscale computing at exascale, and provision a robust and reliable software technology stack that empowers multiscale modellers to transform computer simulations into predictive science."

This will enable high throughput screening of soft targets such as vehicles, people and their personal effects.  

The technology is based on a linear ion trap (LIT) mass spectrometer (MS) operating in a non-scanning mode. A non-scanning LIT allows selective ion monitoring of target threat molecules using optimal voltages for each ion mass without performing a full mass spectral scan. This result is higher sensitivity, simpler control electronics, smaller size, lower power consumption and cost. The limits of detection of LIT-MS instrument are in low parts per billion (ppb) with parts per trillion (ppt) levels achievable with suitable analyte enrichment provided by a pre-concentrator. Once the MS fingerprint of an unknown substance is measured, it can be compared online with a database of known substances enabling real-time rapid identification. 

In 2014 pre-prototype instrument was demonstrated in FP7 Project SNIFFLES. ChemSniff will develop a more compact MS-based than existing instruments on the market with extra capability for rapid scans of solid surfaces using suitable atmospheric ionisation inlet.  Methods for miniaturisation will be applied to all key components including the vacuum system, which is the most robust part. This will be done through improved designs based on results from numerical modelling, operational designs, novel low-cost 3D printing manufacturing, electronics simplification and vacuum system optimisation. 

The final instrument will allow reduced acquisition/operating costs, greater mobility, user friendliness and flexibility. Performance will be benchmarked against a state-of-the-art conventional MS system for in-field analysis The project outcome will be an automated portable MS-based sniffer device, tested and evaluated for a range of security applications and markets by end-users."

674744,"A Mile Of Runway","2015","2017","Unlocking the true potential of general aviation (GA) requires a significant increase in safety measures. Today, pilots of small aircraft often rely on Visual Flight Rules operations (VFR) to detect and avoid obstacles in the air and on the ground. To operate under Instrument Flight Rules, pilots require special equipment and additional licenses. They must also fly in controlled airspace.These extra requirements are not always feasible for many pilots.

In the past five years alone, there have been more than 7,064 GA accidents, resulting in 2,189 fatalities, most often while using VFR. The AMOR project aims to add a powerful level of safety to GA. As a stand-alone, affordable Electronic Detection and Avoid (ED&A) system, AMOR can potentially help pilots avoid 80% of accidents that occur under the current VFR system.  

ED&A provides small aircraft with “electronic eyes”. This allows for collision avoidance that reaches far beyond human visibility. It supports and enhances the safety and efficacy of VFR. What’s more, this safety-added system will unlock the true business potential of GA, allowing for an entirely new market of local small aircraft transport, without the need for additional infrastructure. Small aircraft pilots can simply use the more than 2,750 runways already in operation in Europe. While large civil aircraft are able to utilise Air Traffic Control, small aircraft pilots are often left to their own judgment to operate safely. AMOR will increase their safety by a factor of 5, and, as a stand-alone system, will not interfere with current civil aircraft operations.

The successful completion of AMOR will offer a fully operational ED&A set-up that can be demonstrated to the industry. Within five years, AMOR aims to have supplied approx.0.5% of the current GA market (300k aircraft) with an affordable, independent system at a market price of €20k.

678727,"Multi-ObjecTive design Optimization of fluid eneRgy machines","2015","2018","The MOTOR project focuses on ICT-enabled design optimization technologies for fluid energy machines (FEMs) that transfer mechanical energy to and from the fluid, in particular for aircraft engines, ship propellers, water turbines, and screw machines. The performance of these machines essentially depends on the shape of their geometry, which is described by functional free-form surfaces. Even small modifications have significant impact on the performance; hence the design process requires a very accurate representation of the geometry.
Our vision is to link all computational tools involved in the chain of design, simulation and optimization to the same representation of the geometry, thereby reducing the number of approximate conversion steps between different representations. The improved accuracy and reliability of numerical simulations enables the design of more efficient FEMs by effective design optimization methods. MOTOR also exploits the synergies between the design optimization technologies for the different types of FEMs that have so far been developed independently. 

MOTOR adopts a modular approach for developing novel methodologies and computational tools and integrating them into real process chains, contributing
• a volumetric mesh generator with exact interface matching for multi-domain geometries enabling high-order multi-physics simulations with enhanced accuracy, 
• an isogeometric analysis simulation toolbox for CFD, CSM, and FSI problems and advanced interactive visualization toolkit for high-order solutions, and 
• automatic shape optimization based on a multi-level approach in the parameterization enabling different levels of shape variety to combine design space exploration with local searches. 

The effectiveness of our approach in terms of reduced time to production and increased efficiency of the optimally designed product will be validated by developing four proof-of-concept demonstrators with the modernized process chains."

To turn this vision into reality for European SMEs the I4MS project aims to increase the uptake of ICT by manufacturing  SMEs. It does so through innovation and support actions. The Access to I4MS (XS2I4MS) project is  a support action to advance the European I4MS community, and expand its coverage, notably through the I4MS Mentoring programme which is aimed at supporting the establishment of a network of Digital Innovation Hubs. 
XS2I4MS supports the continued expansion of services provided to DIHs in a number of ways. It has established a special section on the single portal for the I4MS community (WP1). The project builds a solid information base for I4MS in WP2 - the I4MS Observatory. Sharing best practices and dissemination (WP3) aims to extend the reach and impact of IMS as widely as possible through the collection of information about other digitization activities in Europe. Brokerage support and information activities (WP4) are aimed at supporting a key task of the DIH and also focuses on the assessment how DIHs can be financed. Specifically, the outreach activities in WP5 (Mentoring and Coaching for Regional Innovation Hubs) aim to extend the network to include SMEs in regions not currently participating in I4MS. WP6 (Management and Coordination) will ensure effective coordination of tasks.
The XS2I4MS consortium presents a strong mix of organisations to realise excellence and impact. Three large European applied research organisations, TNO, Fraunhofer and VTT, have as their core business transfer of technologies to manufacturing. They have state-of-the art facilities in open innovation. They have programs tailoring technologies and business models to the needs of SMEs.

686454,"Diode Die Fatigue Characterisation and Testing","2016","2018","Future aircraft will use more electrical power, which increases the use of power electronics. The increased demand for electrical power also means that aircraft electrical generators must be scaled up accordingly. One type of power-electronic components is the power diode, consisting of the semiconductor diode die and a package to provide amongst others the electrical connections. In the case of a three-stage brushless generator, a diode rectifier is part of the rotor. The local environment is very harsh; the diodes must endure high temperatures due to heat generation (in the diodes and also in the rest of the generator) in an already hot engine environment, high rotation-induced compression stress, thermally induced shear stress, and low temperatures when the generator is not running. Still, the diodes must perform reliably with low losses.

New ways of packaging diodes using the bare silicon dies, and also new semiconductor technologies such as silicon carbide are currently finding their way to these harsh-environment applications. Both trends promise large benefits for size, weight, thermal and electrical performance. However, it is not always certain if the new packages and components have sufficient long-term reliability in this harsh environment.

DiDi (FaCT) will accurately model the thermo-mechanical stresses to determine an aging model of the diode dies. In parallel, a dedicated test bench will be developed and used to put multiple diode dies to a long-term combined thermo-mechanical stress test. At the end of the project, DiDi combines all information and delivers an optimised and validated aging model of the dies. The result will be very valuable for users of power electronic dies in harsh environments such as aircraft generators, as it allows to optimise the die package design with due regard to long-term reliability, which in turn paves the way towards large weight and efficiency improvements in generators and other equipment."

This will be achieved by establishing a European network of Application Support Centres (ASCs) in the field of PIC technology. The main task of the ASCs is to lower the barrier to Researchers and SMEs for applying advanced PICs, and thus to increase the awareness of the existence of the worldwide unique facility provided by JePPIX (InP and TriPleX PIC design, manufacturing, testing and packaging).
The main objectives of PICs4All are: active scouting opportunities for the use of PICs; promoting the use of the PIC platforms; strengthening Europe’s industrial lead in the business of integrated photonics; bringing together academia to explore photonics and promote its critical importance. These will be achieved by: reaching out to potential users that are not yet aware of the benefits of PIC’s; organizing PIC design courses, workshops; connecting users to optical chip designers; assisting access to Multi-Project Wafer runs for PIC fabrication; actual supporting in layout design and testing of prototype PICs. All the activities are advocated by publicity e.g. newsletters, application notes and participation in conferences and exhibitions.
PICs4All ASCs will actively support users in taking full advantage of the PIC-technology and its deployment in existing and new applications. For this reason it combines the two targets of an EC supported CSA, i.e. enabling the access to advanced design, fabrication and characterisation facilities, and stimulating the innovation potential of users, esp. SMEs, by supplying hands-on support in developing their business cases. All this is achieved by connecting existing PIC-development infrastructure throughout Europe and by lowering the risk at the investment stage in PIC development by enabling access to low-cost prototyping."

This technology of ‘wafer scale heterogeneous integration’ enables high-performance and high-density photonic-electronic (photronic) modules are created having a lower energy consumption, lower packaging complexity and lower cost compared to modules using more traditional interconnection techniques like wire bonding and laser welding of fibre connections. 

Next to the new bonding technology, an integrated module design technology is developed for efficient co-design of hybrid photonic and electronic modules. A library consisting of photonic/electronic standard modules, is created leveraging the process design kits (PDKs) of the most important European foundries of photonic chips in combination with a powerful BiCMOS. These tools are of significantimportance to industry, since they offer photronic module designers a standardised approach that highly facilitates the module design for SMEs and affordable manufacturing by photonic and electronic foundries. The PDK is demonstrated through the prototyping of a 400Gb/s transceiver for data centre applications."

In the field of anaesthesia, the use of regional techniques has led to improved patient outcome and reduced costs compared to general anaesthesia. However, only 60% of anaesthesiologists perform peripheral nerve block procedures regularly. A wider adoption is hindered by lack of adequate technology. Currently they are largely navigating “in the blind”, using indirect measures as well as their anatomical experience to decide where they should inject. The INTUI-VIEW solution will change this.
In the INTUI-VIEW project, Philips, B.Braun and Oslo University Hospital are partnering in order to bring an ultrasound tablet solution with needle tracking technology to the market. The solution is a revolutionary and new technique. It will speed up transition from general anesthesia to regional anesthesia. Patients will receive better, first time right regional anesthesia procedures, avoiding needle misplacements. The clinicians will receive a tool allowing them to do a safer, faster job with more predictable outcome. Finally, it will help hospital and health care systems to be more efficient by avoiding to waste expensive and limited resources.
The scope of the project is to finalize the development of the INTUI-VIEW platform towards market introduction, industrialise and validate it in clinical settings, obtain regulatory approval and prepare market launch (2017). 
The two industrial partners are targeting a turnover of EUR 110 Mio in 2024, and a cumulative sales volume of EUR 700 Mio in 2024. Market adoption is expected to be 14% globally which translates into the treatment of 4.6 mln patients with INTUI-VIEW in 2024.
In total, about 143 jobs will be created in both companies. In the R&D phase 30 FTE in Philips and 12 FTE in BBraun will be employed. After product launch 15 FTE in Philips (operations, service and support) and 86 FTE in B.Braun (production, marketing, sales)."

691495,"eco-friendly Ship Hull film system with fouling Release and fuel saving properties","2015","2018","The aim of the eSHaRk project is to finalise the development of an innovative new fouling protection system for commercial vessels, and to accelerate its market entry.

Fouling, defined as the settlement and growth of marine plants and animals on submerged structures, is a constant challenge for the shipping industry. Fouling results in higher hydrodynamic drag of vessels, which in turn translates into higher fuel usage and greenhouse gas emissions. A number of fouling protection technologies exist on the market, the most widely used being paint-based anti-fouling and fouling release coatings. However, these existing solutions face a number of challenges concerning their environmental impact, the efficiency of their application on ship hulls, and their effectiveness in protecting vessels against fouling.

The eSHaRk project aims to bring a new and innovative solution to the market, which will lead to a paradigm shift in the fouling protection business. This solution is based on self-adhesive foil technology, which not only maintains the current state-of-the-art fouling protection standards but is superior to existing paint-based solutions in terms of eco-friendliness, easiness of application, robustness, and drag reduction effects leading to fuel savings and reduction of GHG emissions.

As part of the eSHaRk project, the surface morphology of the foil will be optimised to enhance its drag reduction, fuel savings and emissions reduction benefits. In addition, a robotised laminator will be finalised to apply the foil on large commercial vessels in an automated way. A cruise vessel will be equipped with the foil to ensure full-scale testing and validation in operational conditions before market entry. The technology will then be ready for commercialisation immediately after project end, in late 2018."
691519,"EVA - patient ventilation beyond limits","2015","2018","EVA - Expiratory Ventilation Assistance – , or expiration by suction, is an innovative method to mechanically ventilate patients and is a key step in ventilation towards less-invasive, tailored and improved patient care as it enables:
1. full ventilation through a thin catheter instead of a thick tube
2. low and – if needed – negative pressures in the lungs promoting blood circulation
3. controlling the expiration, reducing sheer stress, which may prevent lung injury and improve patient outcome.

The EVA technology has already been on the market for some years in its most basic form: the manual, disposable emergency ventilator Ventrain®. Since market launch in 2011, Ventrain® is now being sold by 16 distributors in over 20 countries. 
Ventinova’s flagship is the “EVA device”: a fully automated ventilator based on EVA technology meeting the emerging needs of less invasive, tailored and improved patient care. First is focused on the large markets of elective surgical procedures and emergency care (€ 400 M, globally) and in 2nd generation on ICU-ventilation (€ 500 M, globally), before becoming ‘standard care’ (€ 4.6 billion, globally). The device, currently at TRL6, is still in development and CE marking is expected in Q3 2016. Next to marketing activities, such as organizing workshops and training sessions, and careful selection and support of distributors, penetration of the conservative medical market should be ensured by demonstration of better and tailored patient care using EVA ventilation in pre-clinical studies and controlled clinical trials. These are to be designed and executed in close collaboration with Key Opinion Leaders of established and world leading academic medical centers. 

The described technology and products are protected by 5 patent families and design and brand registrations. The products are manufactured in The Netherlands and a dedicated catheter in Ireland.  After CE marking, large non-EU markets are to be entered (e.g. USA, China, Russia)."

Investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency are currently sub-optimal, forming an important bottleneck for Europe to reach its 20-20-20 targets. Particularly in the building sector, projects require high upfront investments, have high perceived risk, have to deal with complex planning and stakeholder issues, and suffer from split incentives. Since the building sector is also one of the largest energy users in Europe and faces a major and sustained investment challenge, BUILDINTEREST focuses on addressing financial issues in investment in sustainable energy and energy efficiency measures in buildings. BUILDINTEREST will develop three national sustainable energy financing platforms: in The Netherlands (Duurzaam Gebouwd), Italy (ASTER) and France (BPIFrance). These platforms will create a structural dialogue between the building and financial sector and develop essential tools and financial instruments that will increase attractiveness of investments in sustainable energy in buildings. BUILDINTEREST will also develop a roadmap, describing the barriers in financing sustainable energy investments as well as their solutions, and presenting a practical approach to the implementation of these solutions, from financial instruments and contract arrangements to calculation tools and policy measures. The project will also facilitate the implementation of these solutions by the building and financial sector during project operation. To further increase its impact, BUILDINTEREST aims at rapid replication of the national platforms in other European countries. Among other activities, 6 large-scale (inter)national events are organized during the project. BUILDINTEREST will reduce uncertainty regarding investments in sustainable buildings, and increased investors' confidence and trust."

It will achieve this by:
• Coordinating the monitoring, verification and enforcement activities of 13 Market Surveillance Authorities (MSAs) across the Single Market  and Turkey;
• Improving the effectiveness of the MSAs through skills-building training, the provision of guidelines and the promotion of Best Practices.
MSTyr15 will enhance the functioning of the European Single Market by ensuring that the tyres regulatory measures are effectively enforced across MS. It will deliver energy savings >105 GWh/year through removing incorrectly labelled tyres from the market.
Experience and resources for enforcement have been very limited in many MS since the tyres regulations were introduced in 2009. MSTyr15 includes mechanisms for assisting the skills development of less experienced staff and their authorities, supporting the adoption of common best practices and providing budgets to cover the high costs of testing tyres to the required standards.
It will coordinate market surveillance actions involving checks on in excess of 15,000 tyres. It will deliver a higher level of surveillance activities that go beyond testing. The consortium will work closely with other non-participating MSAs across the EEA though its liaison with the Tyres ADCO. Additionally, the MSTyr15 consortium will work together with an Advisory Board comprising of supply-side business, consumer organisations and environmental NGOs. 
The expected results are: 
- Adoption of best practices;
- Market surveillance being undertaken in a more cost effective and consistent manner;
- Increased awareness of and respect for market surveillance by tyres suppliers and users; 
- Effective enforcement of EC Regulation on the labelling of tyres resulting in substantial energy savings expected to be better than 105 GWh/year."
700862,"Leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptors (LILRs) on neutrophils","2016","2018","Neutrophils provide the first-line of antimicrobial defence and orchestrate inflammation. They are tightly regulated by ligand-receptor interactions to ensure pathogen clearance and to prevent host damage. Targeting receptors, with natural or synthetic ligands, that control neutrophil functions is a promising strategy to control infections and inflammation. However, basic knowledge on the role of certain receptors in neutrophil biology, and their interactions with pathogens, has been neglected. This includes leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptors (LILRs), a family of surface receptors that are potent regulators of immune cell activity and potential targets of immunotherapeutic strategies. 

The major aim of this project is to comprehensively understand how LILRs regulate neutrophil functions, to identify bacterial ligands of LILRs and to test whether each bacteria-derived LILR ligand has pro- or anti-inflammatory properties that could be exploited in future immunotherapeutic strategies. For the first time, we will extensively characterise the functional role of four representative LILRs in controlling neutrophil functions. We will screen our newly developed high-throughput bacteria secretome phage display libraries, representative of 20 pathogens and the entire human gut microbiome, for identifying bacterial molecules that bind to LILRs. Finally, we will determine whether each of the ligands acts as a LILR agonist or antagonist. These experiments build upon expertise and preliminary results of the applicant, and upon unique resources of the host. The proposed experiments will expand knowledge of the function of poorly studied LILRs on neutrophils. This will advance knowledge of neutrophils, immune responses and bacterial pathogenesis, paving the way for identifying new strategies for treatment of infection and inflammation."

Surgery is a three dimensional trade and the use of 3D stereoscopic techniques creates a unique and realistic online environment in which residents and surgeons can learn, train and be tested on best-practice based surgical procedures and anatomy. With the INCISION Academy prototype, the value of this innovative educational approach has been demonstrated. To reach market introduction of the INCISION Academy, the SurgASSIST consortium will undertake activities to establish a strong value chain from production to distribution: (1) complete the INCISION Academy curriculum, (2) add 3D virtual reality online surgery to increase product value, (3) establish the LMS system for worldwide distribution, and (4) create the commercialisation strategy. 
Potential users, surgical residents, surgical trainers, and surgeons, cope with an ever increasing workload and need tools to relieve work pressure and improve quality. After this project, the INCISION Academy will be available as worldwide surgical online training tool to train surgical residents with higher quality than before while saving time of surgical trainers. In addition, the INCISION Academy provides a timesaving online alternative for continued medical education of surgeons (CME). The European markets for training of surgical residents and CME amount to € 187,5 and € 158 million respectively. The easy-access, unparalleled high quality, and use of 3D technologies places the INCISION Academy in an excellent commercial position to acquire a significant market share in Europe and subsequently in the USA, China, Southern America and developing countries."

Once the prototype tests are finished, the Scodev is ready for the market. With the patented Scodev, operators of airtankers will improve their dropping-capacity from 1 to 5 droppings per hour. By improving the dropping capacity with 5 times, the suppression-efficiency will improve exponentially up to 8 times, which means that the damage will be reduced between 50 and 80 %. Today worldwide there are only 110 amphibious Canadairs. There are 1200 non-amphibious airtankers, owned by civil protection entities or forest service bodies. In addition there are 1500 large military aircrafts for disaster relief, and 1500 small airtankers SEAT. Meaning the potential is very big and the trend is increasing due to global warming. Due to forest fires millions of hectares are lost and the financial damage is hundreds of billions of Euros. The use of the Scodev will decrease not only financial losses, but the environmental and ecological damages will also be radically reduced."

700986,"Advanced shearography kit and a robotic deployment platform for on-site inspection of wind turbine blades","2016","2018","To achieve a thorough investigation for defect presence on a wind turbine blade, close inspection is required. This implies either trained staff tied with ropes on the blade or dismantling and transferring the blade in a workshop environment. While blade dismantling is scarcely used because it requires very long downtime, human inspection also involve a relatively high delay. 
A solution to this problem is to utilize specially designed platforms that can reach the blade and implement faster inspections on site. However, current systems are not very agile or cannot reach close enough to the blade in order to use a high quality nondestructive technique. Hence, they are mostly used to carry out mere visual inspections. 
To deal with the aforementioned challenge, our team will commercialize WInspector. WInspector consists of an agile robotic platform able to climb up the wind turbine tower and deploy an advanced Digital Shearography kit that carries out the inspection of a blade at a depth of up to 50mm. 
Users of WInspector benefit through early detecting emerging defects unseen in a visual inspection performed by competing solutions, with a significantly lower downtime for the WTB, and free of dangerous human labor. 
We have tested and validated the capabilities of WInspector in relevant environment and based on feedback received by wind farm operators, including project participant Gamesa and Iberdola (who has supported us in writing for this application), we are now ready to take the next steps and complete product development allowing us to bring WInspector into the market. 
Our vision is to grow our businesses by €19.88 million in gross sales by 2023 and keep growing at 58.8% annually from 2023 onwards. Through our business growth, we will create 181 new jobs. 
It is our strong belief that the Fast Track to Innovation Pilot is the ideal financial instrument for us to accelerate the procedures required for commercialization."
701368,"We are the 1%, we stand with the 99%: reactions of high-status groups faced with social change attempts from low-status groups","2016","2018","One of the most widespread social phenomena that we witness nowadays is the emergence of collective action movements in which low-status groups mobilize in order to trigger social change (e.g. Arab Spring, Indignados, the Occupy Movement). Interest in collective action has mushroomed in the last decade, as confirmed by the fact that from the 1602 hits found in Psycarticles using the “collective action” term, more than 70% of them date from 2000 or later. However, this research is almost exclusively focused on low-status groups without taking into account high-status groups’ reactions. Existing literature on high-status groups either puts the emphasis on individual psychological processes linked to prejudice reduction or on the reinforcement of status quo. Yet, the likelihood of social change and, ultimately, the unfolding of intergroup conflict cannot be understood without considering both low-status groups’ actions and high-status groups’ reactions. This project directly targets high-status groups’ role in social change. We analyze high-status groups’ support for normative (i.e., socially accepted protest such as demonstrations) vs. nonnormative collective action behaviors (i.e., radical protest such as the use of violence).

This research project main goals are to examine: 1) psychological mechanisms explaining high-status groups’ support for normative and nonnormative collective action; 2) disentangle two theoretically contrasting perspectives by analyzing moderating conditions at different levels that lead to higher support from high-status groups in response to normative and nonnormative collective action. The main idea developed is that normative and nonnormative collective action will prove effective in eliciting high-status group support in different situations. In general, this will depend on a matching between the type of action and the individual (Question 1), the type of low-status demand (Question 2) and the socio-structural context (Question 3)."

GPC has received extensive attention as an interesting alternative for ordinary cement-based concrete as a step forward to Eco-friendly construction and thus reducing the environmental impacts of conventional construction methods and materials. Geopolymer mortars are also of great interest to be used as a sustainable matrix for conservation and strengthening of existing structures. Geopolymer concrete made of fly ash and blast furnace slag binary system is the main focus of this proposal.
The project objective will be achieved through advanced multi-scale modelling and limited experimental testing. A chemo-transport framework, in which the transport and degradation are coupled at different length scales, will be implemented for the first time to simulate the micro-structural development and degradation in GPC systems since early ages. The realization of the project will be a great step forward on the current knowledge on GPC materials and of interest for both academy and industry. The project main outputs will be the developed multi-scale framework, time-dependent chloride concentration levels at reinforcing bars' surfaces as the main indicator of durability in RC structures, and design and construction guidelines for durable GPCs. 
The project will also fill the current gaps in the knowledge of the fellow. After the project, the fellow is expected to become a leader in the field of GPC materials and multi-scale modelling. Advanced training on complementary skills will also be given to the fellow to prepare him for independent excellent research and finding a permanent academic position."

However, current interactive storytelling approaches face important limitations in the implementation of digital characters. On the one hand, some systems provide very capable socially virtual agents used as characters, but enacted in a virtual world where technology is rather a barrier to effective creative thinking and collaboration. On the other hand, settings with tangible objects facilitate discussion in groups as well as the development of relevant critical social skills, but with characters unable to show advanced smart capabilities to enrich storytelling for a more effective process.
Hence, given the current state-of-the-art of technology, the main objectives of COBOTNITY are: to timely provide an affordable community of hybrid artificial agents (called surface-bots) capable of drawing a high range of digital expressions while providing tangible interaction to be used in collaborative creative storytelling; and, to provide a better understanding on how a surface-bot community can effectively be used to foster creative thinking and social awareness on societal issues. The project proposal draws on the knowledge of HMI on interaction with artificial agents (both virtual and robots) along with its expertise on interactive storytelling, as well as on the candidate’s experience on creativity in collaboration. COBOTNITY is relevant to the MSCA Work Programme because it will allow developing new research competences, ensuring advantageous skill and knowledge transfer, and opening new perspectives in diverse sectors for potential technology transfer such as entertainment, museum interaction settings and learning games."
702149,"Spatiotemporal and In-situ Spectroscopic Crystallization Studies of Microporous Materials","2016","2018","Microporous materials are crystalline, framework structures that contain pores of less than 2 nm. They commonly exhibit robust hydrothermal stability and are used in a wide range of areas including catalysis, separations, ion exchange and adsorption where their shape and size selectivity often shows superior performance over other materials. They are formed by crystallization from amorphous inorganic oxides, but the underlying mechanisms that govern the crystallization of microporous materials are poorly understood, despite extensive work in this area. This lack of understanding means that the development of new materials and compositions is an inefficient trial and error process mainly guided by heuristics. In this work I propose to study the formation principles of microporous materials through 3D spatiotemporal element mapping and monitoring the incorporation of spectroscopically active and catalytically interesting heteroatoms, namely copper and titanium, in distinct framework structures. This proposal uses two distinct approaches (ex-situ STXM and in-situ spectroscopy) to study two different inorganic chemistries (aluminophosphate and silicate) with two different spectroscopically active heteroatoms (copper and titanium) and four different microporous material frameworks (AFI, CHA, MFI and MWW) in order to probe the underlying crystallization mechanisms behind microporous material synthesis and crystallization. The unprecedented combination of 3D spatiotemporal element mapping at various stages of crystallization combined with in-situ spectroscopic studies of catalytically active elements will lead to previously unavailable information about the underlying mechanisms governing the formation of these materials. These insights will lead to innovations in synthesizing both known and novel materials and compositions."
702402,"Oscillatory long-Range Coherence in Attention","2016","2018","Attention -the ability to focus selectively on task relevant information and resist distraction- plays a critical role in many everyday life situations, such as in school or while driving. With an almost constant stream of information reaching us through smart phones and computers, our world becomes increasingly distracting, requiring enhanced attentional capabilities. This calls for new approaches to improve attention, also benefiting patients populations suffering from attention deficits. Is it possible to safely improve attention without medication? And how does the brain actually guides attention and resist distractions? The proposed research aims to answer these questions by combining a novel brain stimulation technique, transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) with state of the art neuroimaging methods. It will specifically test the intriguing hypothesis that attention can be enhanced by synchronizing rhythmic activity between two brain regions previously shown to be involved in attention. In the first study I will assess the effects of stimulation on attention performance, while simultaneously measuring neural activity using electroencephalogram (EEG). This will allow me to determine to what extent tACS can improve attention and investigate the causal role of neural oscillations in attention. In the second study, tACS will be combined with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) allowing to bridge the literature on neural oscillations (derived from EEG research) and attention networks (derived from fMRI research). Specifically, it will provide novel insights into the exact neural network subserving oscillatory activity associated with attention. Taken together, this project will not only investigate an innovative way to improve attention, with important implication for future clinical studies, but will also have a major contribution to cognitive neuroscience theories of attention."

Finding these documents is important in the shared process of collective memory creation by Bosnians, but also for academic research and post-war reconstructions. For EU citizens, understanding Sarajevo citizens’ experience can help them to understand the realities of life of the actual war contexts (i.e. Syria). As a citizen who experienced the war, an architect and a researcher of the war cities, my research objective is to expand architectural research methods by focusing on how war affects the transformation of cities through a process combining architecture and media research. I will apply interdisciplinary research methods used in architecture/planning (i.e. geographic information system - GIS), media studies (i.e. video) and anthropology (i.e. interviews). To use media tools is a complement to architect research and representation (i.e. video) modes because they create documents (i.e. drawings) understandable only to architects. Research will be accessible to scientific and general public through a web platform, called Evidencity, which will include map-based, multimedia research archive. Regarding to my academic career this project contributes: obtaining academic profile in the fields of architectural research methods and media for researching of different war cities; advancing my skills as an architect (i.e. analysis of the destroyed city) for working on projects related to the post-war reconstruction. The European continent is constantly dealing with states of war, on its territories (Ukraine) or on its borders (Libya-Italy). Proposal aims to contribute using research results to create interdisciplinary guidelines for architectural research to the emerging field of urban conflict studies that will be applicable to the other war cities."
702511,"Urban networks: multidisciplinary research into the formation of early urban societies in Campania (Italy)","2016","2018","Living in cities has been one of the most transformative innovations in human history: it has heavily impacted social and political interaction between people, and has significantly changed the relationship between man and his natural environment. Understanding why people in the past started living together in cities in the first place, provides crucial tools for the study of urban life from a comparative perspective.
One of the earliest urbanised regions of Europe was Campania, in Southern Italy. The first traces of urbanisation date to the early first millennium BCE. Innovative archaeological research on urbanisation in Campania is still lacking. With the URBANet project, I propose an innovative approach to early Campanian urbanisation, informed by multidisciplinary perspectives. 
I start with the specific hypothesis that the processes underlying the formation of early urban societies in the past were social and political. At the same time, the topographical component was fundamental. Furthermore, early urban societies interacted with each other. This observation suggests, in addition, that urbanisation also rose as the result of connectivity and networks. 
I propose to verify the hypothesis with the collection and analysis of data, focusing on four selected case-studies. The innovative method combines qualitative (anthropological) methods with computed analysis (GIS and social network analysis). Training goals are set to bolster my research and project management skills. 
The expertise at the VU University in similar projects ensures the best possible institutional environment for the execution of the URBANet project."

For decades, scholars have been seeking to understand why and how neighbourhoods change. Integrating different strands of the literature, it is suggested that neighbourhood transitions occur due to the interaction of cyclic dynamics generated by neighbourhoods’ local contexts, and structural transformations generated by higher level contexts. The interaction and the relative roles of these processes have not been investigated so far. Because research designs used to date cannot account for both types of effect, this proposal points to comparative research in contrasting regional and national contexts as a promising direction. Key methodological issues are identified in the current state-of-the-art with regard to the possibility of conducting effective comparative research on the topic: comparability of results, conceptualization of neighborhood change and distinguishing the relative impact of processes at different levels. The proposed research aims at addressing these issues in setting up a systematic approach to comparative analysis of neighbourhood change. The approach relies on the application of methods from social mobility research which has been tackling equivalent challenges. The approach will be implemented in an empirical comparative analysis of neighbourhood change in the Netherlands and Israel."

In doing so, EDU-DEM will 1) explore the correlations between educational attainment and civil society characteristics and agency; 2) assess how formal and non-formal education systems and programmes increase the attention to and comprehension of local politics; 3) identify innovative, multi-scalar and context-specific approaches to nurture democratization processes through education.
EDU-DEM brings together the disciplines of education and international development while drawing from and contributing to research on democratization, civil society and agency. Uganda serves as a case study as it exemplifies a striking paradox occurring in the majority of sub-Saharan African states. Despite a steady increase of funds and the commitment to support development through the grassroots level, experts witness weak democratization processes on the ground. Leading local CSOs consist of a small group of well-funded, urban-based organisations, led by a highly educated elite, with only a token presence in rural areas. On the other hand, the majority of grassroots and less-visible civil society actors are frequently characterized by political illiteracy –not to mention the country’s poorly educated wider civil sphere. 
The findings of this project will be published in a monograph, two journal articles, policy briefs and publicized to a non-specialized audience via outreach activities (e.g.: dedicated website, media and blog articles, round-table discussions)."
703071,"Muslims condemning violent extremism - An interdisciplinary analysis of public initiatives in the Netherlands and Norway 2001-2015","2016","2018","The project comprehends an interdisciplinary study on the dilemma faced by Muslims whether or not to explicitly disavow violent extremism. It explores how Muslim organisations and youth groups in the Netherlands and Norway have responded to calls to publicly condemn violent extremism. Special attention is paid to how young Muslim women and men have used specific strategies to gain media coverage, and the gendered aspects of these strategies. The project aims to analyse recent historical developments in the two countries in theoretical and empirical depth, by studying public debates and specific public initiatives undertaken by Muslims in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks in 2001, the murder of Theo van Gogh in the Netherlands in 2004, and the 22/7 attacks by Anders Behring Breivik in Norway in 2011. It combines a comparative historical approach with theory and methodology of religious-, media-, cultural- and gender studies. The project fills an important gap in the growing body of research on Muslims in Europe: a lot of scholarly attention is paid to public discourses that stigmatise Muslims, but far less on how people with a Muslim background confirm or subvert dominant images in their interactions with the media. Scholars have described the pressure that young Muslims perceive to explicitly disavow terrorism, but a thorough analysis of their responses has yet to be made. The project will contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms of social cohesion in contemporary European society at a time of growing global threats. Hosting arrangements at the Department of Philosophy and Religious Studies at Utrecht University guarantee excellent training and research facilities. The vibrant interdisciplinary research network at the Department and the intense supervision by the awarded professor of religious studies Birgit Meyer will greatly contribute to the project and strengthen the interdisciplinary knowledge, skills and research network of the Experienced Researcher."
703141,"BEyond Willpower: InterTemporal CHoice Improved through NudginG","2016","2018","Many decisions involve intertemporal choice: a choice between options whose consequences occur at different points in time. For example, choosing whether or not to eat cake when you also want to lose weight this month. Remarkably, we often choose small immediate rewards (e.g. eat cake) over large future benefits (e.g. lose weight), despite different intentions. How can we become better at resisting temptations and align our behavior with our long-term intentions? ‘Nudging’, a concept from behavioral economics, appears a promising strategy: by designing choice contexts that exploit our cognitive biases, it gently guides us into making choices that are better for ourselves and society. One way to nudge intertemporal choice is by ‘framing’ the timing of the choice outcome in a certain way: e.g. we make more patient choices when future outcomes are described in terms of calendar dates (‘on May 1’) than in terms of corresponding delays (‘in 30 days’). However, two problems hamper the use of time framing in practice: we do not know how time framing works nor who is susceptible to it. If we do not address these problems, we will not understand our seemingly irrational choices and we will not be able to develop framing interventions that change behavior. To solve these problems, I will determine the mechanisms and individual determinants of time framing in intertemporal choice, using new computational models, functional MRI, and an online experiment. My working hypothesis is that time framing changes how we perceive time and that individual differences in time perception determine whether or not time framing changes behavior. The proposed research will provide scientists, policymakers, clinicians, and businesses with a deep understanding of how framing influences our choices. This knowledge will guide smart policies, personalized interventions, and nudge-based technologies that promote future-minded behavior and reduce societal costs in Europe and the rest of the world."
703164,"Microtubule Dynamics during angiogenesis","2016","2018","Restoring normal vessel structure and function is now considered as a highly promising therapeutic opportunity for angiogenesis-related diseases, including cancer. Despite extensive use of microtubule targeting compounds in vascular-directed anticancer treatment, knowledge of the cellular mechanisms underlying microtubule regulation during angiogenesis is still elusive. By combining my previous experience in endothelial cell biology and the long term expertise of the host laboratory in microtubules dynamics as well as in high resolution imaging techniques, our project is aimed at studying microtubule dynamics and microtubule function in the precise context of sprouting angiogenesis. To achieve that goal, we propose to address the role of microtubule regulatory proteins using advanced high resolution live imaging of 3D culture of endothelial cells. We will identify endothelial specific MT regulators through expression, interaction and functional studies, assess their impact on microtubule dynamics during 3D tubulogenesis and validate their role both in the 3D morphogenesis model and in vivo, using zebrafish. This project is aimed at answering fundamental questions in the angiogenesis field as well as providing new opportunities for therapeutic strategies. At the same time, my experience in the laboratory of Dr Akhmanova will allow me to develop knowledge and skills in order to prepare me to reach a position of professional maturity."
703523,"Analysis of protein corona formation on nanoparticles by DNA barcodes","2016","2018","Nanoparticles (from 1 to 1000 nM in diameter) are widely used in point-of-care diagnostics due to their large surface area and versatile biofunctionalization. However, when used in matrices such as blood plasma and other complex biological fluids, nanoparticles are known to attract proteins that form coronas around the nanoparticles. These coronas block binding sites, cause non-specific interactions, and cause aggregation among the nanoparticles, resulting in lower signals, higher background, and large variabilities in the assays. Proteomics studies have analyzed the overall protein corona composition on different nanoparticles, depending on size, surface chemistry etc. Microscopic studies have been used to monitor the kinetics of corona formation on nanoparticles in simplified systems. However, protein-protein interactions and cooperative effects in corona formation, and their interference in diagnostic assays involving affinity reagents, have not been studied yet in a comprehensive way. In this proposal, I will adress those questions using DNA-assisted protein technology, where proteins are labeled with DNA barcode tags. The ligation of proximal barcodes will reveal protein-protein co-localizations within coronas and their interactions with affinity reagents such as antibodies. The analysis will give unique insight in the internal structure of coronas and will shed light on the origin of corona-induced nanoparticle-nanoparticle aggregation processes and nanoparticle-surface interactions, which is very important for nanoparticle-based point-of-care diagnostics."
703696,"Dynamics of femtosecond laser ablation of trapped dielectric and metallic nanoparticles","2016","2018","During the last decades the use of pulsed lasers has been increasingly exploited for many applications in research, industry and healthcare via cutting, removing or depositing material. What many of these processes have in common is that so much energy is deposited in the target that its optical properties change during an individual laser pulse. Moreover, in applications like EUV generation and pulsed laser deposition, the optical properties of the ejected particles become spatially inhomogeneous. Thus, to predict/optimize the energy deposition, one needs to understand the complex interplay between the laser and the dynamically and spatially changing material properties. 
The ADMEP project aims to theoretically and experimentally study the dynamics of the material properties in nano- to micro-scale particles upon irradiation with fs-laser pulses. In order to theoretically model the absorption of light, the spatial inhomogeneity must be taken into account by performing finite-difference time-domain simulations in which the optical properties are dynamically updated each time step. To isolate the effects of the dynamics of the carrier density and temperature from the ones of their spatial inhomogeneity, experiments on trapped small spherical nanoparticles will be carried out. For small enough spheres, the transient material properties can be assumed to be homogeneous over their size. Afterwards, the laser interaction with larger and non-spherical particles will be studied. Finally, the aftermath (expansion of e- plasma, melting and ablation) will be investigated via fs-resolved microscopy both at the host and secondment facilities. These findings will find their way through a network consisting of researchers at the secondment (ARCNL, ASML) and at the University of Twente.
The theoretical and experimental experience, combined with working with a private/public partnership will prepare the candidate for a career as a group leader in basic and applied research."
703861,"Functionalized carbon-supported Au Nanoparticles for Selective Oxidation Catalysis","2016","2018","Oxidation of alcohols is one of the key reactions in the fine chemicals industry and is crucial for the conversion of biomass into valuable chemicals. Au catalysts demonstrate promising activity and selectivity in the aerobic oxidation of alcohols, however, they require addition of bases to operate at low temperatures, and often suffer from deactivation due to particle growth. Here I propose a strategy to circumvent these issues: employing Au catalysts supported on carbon materials with introduced basic surface groups. 
I will prepare and characterize a series of basic and novel “super-basic” carbon materials. Colloidally prepared gold nanoparticles will be deposited onto these supports, and the resulting catalysts will be tested for the selective oxidation of two relevant types of alcohols. Key will be the use of advanced characterization techniques to understand how the basic surface groups on the carbon affect the activity, selectivity and stability of Au catalysts in alcohol oxidation. I will address parameters such as changes in surface properties, shape and electronic properties of the Au nanoparticles, and changes in the adsorption strength of reactants, intermediates and products as a result of the different carbon surface functionalizations. 
The outcomes of this project will advance our understanding of the properties of Au nanoparticles supported on functionalized carbon materials, and in a broader sense generate insight into metal-support effects in catalysis, and hence facilitate the rational design of supported metal catalysts. Furthermore, this project will allow me to strengthen and expand my skills and expertise in the field of catalysis and materials chemistry, build professional network and establish my position as a researcher in Europe, which will help me to reach full independence in the future."
703929,"Development of an in vitro cellular model to predict the immunological impact of dietary proteins","2016","2018","As the world population continues to grow and a shortage of protein supply is foreseen, there is a need to identify new and sustainable protein sources. While these alternative proteins must be of high nutritional quality, they also need to be safe for consumption. Dietary proteins and their digestion products can influence a number of regulatory systems, including the immune system. By interacting with elements of the immune system, proteins can help balance and stabilize immune responses, but may also trigger adverse effects such as allergic reactions. While the effects of proteins and peptides on the adaptive immunity have been examined in a number of studies, few have studied how these molecules are absorbed through the small intestine and interact with the innate immune system. Since, in order to trigger an immune response proteins must first be transported across the intestinal wall and interact with the innate immune system, understanding these processes is key to determining the immunological effects of protein consumption. The aim of the proposed project is to develop an in vitro model to evaluate the impact of dietary proteins on the immune system. This research will first examine the uptake of proteins and their digests across the intestinal wall using cellular models mimicking the intestinal epithelium and subsequently investigate the effect of the absorbed proteins/peptides on the immune system’s key players, including the dendritic and T cells. The model system that this research aims to develop could help shed light on the roles played by dietary proteins in regulating intestinal immunity and serve as a tool to evaluate the immunological properties of novel and sustainable proteins. Thus, this research is of relevance not only to the European food industry, but also to public health."
704364,"Functional optical probes for otology","2017","2018","Various pathologies directly impede the conduction of sound through the human middle ear, and thereby produce a ‘conductive’ hearing loss which is the second most prevalent health issue globally. According to Hearing Health Foundation more than 360 million people suffer from hearing disorders worldwide. Hearing depends on a series of events that change sound waves in the air into electrical signals. Sounds that travel down the ear canal set the surface of the flexible eardrum or tympanic membrane (TM) into rapid pico- to nanometer scale vibrations.  These motions are coupled to the inner ear by the ossicular chain (the malleus, incus, and stapes). Since the TM and ossicular chain are the primary portal through which acoustic stimuli reach the inner ear, pathological changes in the TM or ossicular chain result in conductive hearing losses.  Accurate diagnosis of middle-ear diseases is critical to effective and timely treatments of hearing loss. No currently available clinical technique is capable of simultaneously visualizing and quantifying the structure and sound-induced vibration of the middle ear in vivo. Recently, a new functional imaging technique based on optical coherence tomography (OCT) and the principle of vibrography for middle ear imaging was demonstrated. In this method, termed OCT-vibrography, a speaker is used to excite acoustic vibration in the tissue, and the resulting tissue displacement is captured by OCT. The goal of this project is to make for the first time a miniaturized OCT-vibrography probe for middle ear imaging at high frequencies. The miniaturized probe will be designed through integrated optics which will enable high-speed imaging. The system will operate in two modes: static imaging mode for examining biofilms and ear infections behind the ear drum; dynamic imaging mode for capturing high frequency (up to 20 kHz) oscillations in the middle ear structures. The operation of the miniaturized probes will be validated on ex vivo specimens."

The major part of hydrocarbons on Earth is found in crude oil. The depletion of the latter while demand for it is increasing, and the geopolitical risk related, boost the use of different hydrocarbon sources. 
The Fischer Tropsch synthesis (FTS) from ‘syngas’ comprises the exothermic synthesis and WGS reactions to obtain gasoline fraction (C5-C12), hydrocarbons (paraffins and olefins) and oxygenates in a wide range of boiling points, from methane to waxes. Transition metals are typically used in FTS process due to their considerable activity, cobalt being the preferred one due to its higher activity for FTS, selectivity toward linear products, stability, low activity towards water-gas shift (WGS) reaction and low price.
Recently, Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as promising precursors for the synthesis of nanomaterials, due to their unique structure, atomic metal dispersion and textural properties.
The goal of this proposal is to design, to control and to apply the MOF mediated synthesis to obtain outstanding cobalt based catalysts for the Fischer Tropsch synthesis, and to set the ground of this potentially universal method for the synthesis of metal supported catalysts.
The project will be carried out at Delft University of Technology (TU Delft) within the Catalysis Engineering (CE) section of the Chemical Engineering department (ChemE) and in close collaboration with industry.
The resulting catalysts are expected to possess unique catalytic properties by virtue of their controlled synthesis, leading to the preparation of paramount catalysts which will be studied for the first time in the FTS."
704506,"Integrating memories: Exploring knowledge integration enhancement at the intersection of education and neuroscience","2016","2018","Learning about the world is most effective when we can relate new information to previously learned knowledge structures, but underlying neurocognitive processes are still poorly understood. To successfully structure our knowledge, we can integrate separately learned instances by inferring an association between them. In the brain, this integration of old and new memories has been suggested to be facilitated by the reinstatement of prior knowledge structures during new learning, but it remains unclear exactly how reinstatement enables effective building of such knowledge structures. Especially in real-world educational settings it is vital to understand how to effectively build knowledge, but thus far direct translation of neuroscientific insights to educational practice has proven challenging. 

Better understanding how we build new knowledge on existing knowledge structures can lead to more efficient educational strategies and programs, helping us to learn more efficiently. I here propose to examine the neural processes underlying these reinstatement and integration processes during learning of educationally relevant information and explore how actively controlling them can benefit educational knowledge building.

More specifically, I aim to examine educationally relevant knowledge building by 1) implementing parallel educational and neuroscientific knowledge integration paradigms and 2) combining results and conclusions from both paradigms to 3) explore how students can most effectively build educational knowledge structures. This approach will yield novel insights into active control of knowledge building processes that can be employed to construct more efficient learning strategies in education. This novel approach enables investigating educationally relevant knowledge building in the brain, yielding essential fundamental insights while concurrently generating new knowledge building strategies."
704544,"Developing Structure-Reactivity Relationships of the Zeolite Catalysed Bio-alcohol Mediated Aromatic Alkylation Processes via a Multi-Spectroscopic Investigative Approach","2016","2018","A top priority of the European Union under the Horizon 2020 protocol is that chemical industries must reduce their dependence on fossil fuels. In the petro-chemical industry, aromatic alkylation processes using olefins as alkylating agents and zeolites or inorganic Lewis acids as catalysts are still exclusively depending on fossil fuels. Other limitations of these processes include corrosion, toxicity, contamination and undesired side reactions. Hence, I will develop new zeolite-based catalytic technologies for the alkylation of aromatics using bio-alcohols (derived from biomass) as alkylating agents. Here I hypothesize that MWW type medium pore zeolites and MTW/MOR type large pore zeolites are ideal catalysts for aromatic alkylation using short and long chain alcohols, respectively. In this regard, the specific project aims are: (1) evaluation of these specific medium and large pore zeolites for the production of alkylated aromatics with high selectivity and purity in bio-alcohol mediated aromatic alkylation processes, (2) proper process optimization by tuning all reaction parameters in order to achieve excellent selectivity at reasonably higher reactivity and (3) elucidation of the catalytic cycle and deactivation mechanism and establishment of the structure-property-function relationships through the application of advanced in situ/operando (micro-)spectroscopic techniques. Altogether, the acquired knowledge from this research project will help the chemical community to design future catalyst materials for bio-alcohol mediated aromatic alkylation processes. 
   This project will be carried out within Inorganic Chemistry and Catalysis (ICC) group at Utrecht University under the supervision of Prof. Bert M. Weckhuysen. This will allow me to develop my knowledge and skills in the fields of heterogeneous catalysis and in situ spectroscopy in order to steer my future as an independent researcher in the direction of heterogeneous catalysis for organic syntheses."
704585,"PROCess-based sEamless development of useful Earth system predictions over lanD","2017","2018","The modelling community achieved steady progress in dynamical climate prediction using Earth System models and the last decade has seen an accelerated development for the land surface component. This has led to predictions that are now considered useful for some societal applications over “hot-spot” land areas such as the Euro-Mediterranean. However, forecasts performance over land is still substantially weaker compared with ocean, due to the lack of observations, which has hampered the development of well-constrained land processes models. While benefiting from daily verification, the models used for the prediction of the short time-scales (from weather to seasons) include only that part of the surface variability for which observations are available and that can be modeled/initialized to positively contribute to the forecasts (verification-based approach). As a consequence, they unavoidably lack some processes such as those related to ecosystems and their variability. On the other hand, longer time-scales (interannual to centennial) models used for climate variability/change research contain comprehensive vegetation and soil schemes intended to represent as many processes as possible, even those that are still poorly constrained or understood. Through the synergy between process-based and verification-based approaches the ambitious objective of this project is to obtain a practicable seamless development across scales of the land modelling applied to Earth System predictions. The main goal will be to obtain verifiable land processes models to enhance the performance of the predictions across scales and to demonstrate unprecedented useful applications for the energy sector. A fundamental contribution to fill in the gap between short- and long-term Earth System predictions will come from the emerging availability of reliable land surface observations from remotely sensed satellite campaigns that will provide novel observational constraints to land processes models."
704659,"Flexible Li ion Batteries via Nanocrystal-Nanocarbon Scaffolded Structures","2016","2018","The aim of this proposal is to develop next generation flexible high-energy density Li ion batteries. This project seeks to advance this field by developing generalized methodologies to effectively interface flexible nano carbon scaffolds with inorganic nanocrystals, and to obtain tailor made hierarchical assemblies as building blocks. Fabrication of these hierarchical materials whose chemical and mechanical properties can be optimized at the nano, micro and millimeter scale are key to ensure both high energy and power density, and structurally flexible components. Our strategy will significantly increase the loading of electro-active particles (nanocrystals) and maximize their contact/exposure to electrolytes in optimized conditions, which will improve the electrochemical properties of nanostructures. Parallel, by applying in situ electrochemical-Li-NMR-Neutron depth profile and XRD, the proposed multi-scale approach will deepen the understanding of fundamental issues such as Li\ diffusion path ways in nanocrystal-carbon scaffolded structures (Li ion kinetics), volume expansion of nanocrystals (stress/strain issues), thermal management (heat dissipation), gas evolution (via electrolyte decomposition) and various modes of particle degradation during battery charge/discharge cycling."
704830,"Spin-Selection using Chirality: A Supramolecular Approach","2016","2018","Organic electronics which exploits charges (electrons or holes) of π-conjugated molecules/polymers has garnered attention in the past decade due to the low cost, ease of processability and most importantly the flexibility to tune the electronic properties through chemical synthesis. In addition to charge, spin as a quantum number provides exciting opportunities to store data in memory devices, in spin filters and spin-based organic light-emitting diodes. Typically in spintronic devices, switching of the magnetism of one of the ferromagnetic layers is required to attain spin-selectivity. Recent works have demonstrated high (>60%) spin-selectivity in organized chiral double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) without the use of magnetic materials. The high spin-selectivity was attributed to the creation of chiral field in which the electron-transport takes place through DNAs. It is to be noted that the organization of DNA strands is pivotal in achieving high spin-selectivity. Presently, the main focus is on bio-inspired molecules such as peptides and DNAs. Due to the versatility and processability of organic semiconductors, they are ideal candidates for obtaining chiral electron flow leading to functional organic spintronic devices without ferromagnets. Thus the present proposal aims at design, synthesis and characterization of chiral π-conjugated oligomers and polymers with ordered supramolecular organization on surfaces as testbeds for spin-selective electron transport. Chiral fluorene oligomers/polymers are known to form cholesteric liquid crystal phases on surfaces. Based on this, our design includes chiral fluorene based oligomers and polymers attached with pendant acid groups to anchor on surfaces to obtain chiral supramolecular organization desired for the electron-transport. This project will be the first demonstration of chiral-spin selectivity in synthetic self-assembled structures and will pave way for a plethora of spin-based applications."
704992,"Cracking the Nucleo-Olivary Code","2016","2018","For animals and humans to be successful in their environments, their motor and cognitive behavior must be adjusted to the constantly changing reality at a millisecond-timescale. For example, it is fairly simple for a brain to determine which muscles need to be activated to catch a falling object, but much harder to determine when and for how long. Without correct timing of the executive brain functions, as happens in some neurological disorders, the individual is unable to produce smooth and accurate movements and will also have difficulties with a range of cognitive functions requiring orchestration of distinct mental operations. The tripartite olivo-cerebellar system (OCS), which is formed by the inferior olive (IO), cerebellar cortex

Interestingly, all three areas, IO, CTX and CN, have intrinsic oscillatory properties and together they constitute a reverberating microcircuit, beating with well-timed responses to requests from the sensorimotor system. The ultimate timing of the output of this system, by which it imposes its effects upon the rest of the brain, is mediated by the CN. Indeed, decades of research on the OCS has resulted in detailed concepts as to how it may generate and control computations with high temporal complexity. However, due to methodological difficulties the function of the nucleo-olivary (NO) pathway, which links the CN with the IO, has been neglected, hindering completion of the cerebellar theory. To crack the relevant temporal
codes of this loop I have developed specific viral optogenetic tools that allow for targeted control of the NO pathway. Using them I will define the NO interactions that take place during behavior and learning, and examine how these interactions are perturbed in neurological disorders."

The aim of the proposal is to provide a comprehensive analysis of how individual health is affected (both in the short and in the long-run) when recessions cause uncertainty on the labour-market. To achieve this aim, I will exploit two major recessions – the 2008 Great Recession and the 1990s Swedish recession – as well as particularly rich administrative data to answer two well-posed and policy-relevant questions: 

(1) Do individuals who experience major labour-market uncertainty during by recessions suffer from health disorders in the short-run? 
(2) Do recessions at career entry negatively affect health over the life-course – and in particular in the long-run? 

To adress these questions, the proposal will tackle two related and complementary specific objectives:

(1) Analyse the short-term consequences of the drastic cuts in art subsidies in the Netherlands in the wake of the 2008 Great Recession – which triggered major labour market uncertainty in the art sector – on health outcomes for individuals in the art sector.
(2) Investigate the long-run health effects of graduating in the 1990s Swedish Great recession using an innovative life-course perspective.

Both the framework and the methodology used in these two projects are challenging and new. First, I exploit natural experiments as exogenous shocks on labour-market conditions, which allows deriving causal estimates. Second, I use particularly rich linked administrative data over long periods of time, which enables me to take a life-course perspective. I strongly believe that this unprecedented combination of the original concepts, the methodology, that is completely new to the field, and my particularly large and rich datasets will provide a completely new avenue to understand how individual health responding to labour-market uncertainty caused by recessions is affected, both in the short and long-run."
705217,"Unconditional parental regard: Its nature and its consequences","2016","2018","Unconditional parental regard refers to parents accepting children for who they are, even when they disapprove of children’s achievements (e.g., school grades). Psychological theory holds that children internalize unconditional regard to feel worthy for who they are. Children may thus feel less pressured to excel, and become more intrinsically motivated and less afraid of failure. However, unconditional regard has received little empirical scrutiny. The main objectives of this 24-month Marie Curie IF-GF are (a) to investigate the nature and consequences of unconditional parental regard in childhood; (b) to provide advanced training in experimental research (pioneered by the partner organization) and intervention development (pioneered by the beneficiary); and (c) to provide advanced training in soft skills and entrepreneurial skills. Thus, it brings the applicant closer to mid-term career goals of becoming a leading expert and establishing a research group in the field of socialization—a field where the EU currently lags behind the US. In this project, one study explores how parents express unconditional regard (Study 1). Two experiments investigate the causal effects of unconditional regard on children’s self-worth and motivation (Study 2-3). An observational-longitudinal study investigates whether the effects of unconditional regard sustain over time in children’s lives (Study 4). The studies will be conducted in specialized laboratories under supervision of leading experts. The project strengthens the EU’s position in the field of socialization, and establishes a long-term cross-disciplinary collaboration between the applicant and participating parties. The results will have timely societal implications: Contemporary EU youth suffer more ill-being and motivational problems than did previous generations. To help alleviate these problems, the applicant will develop and implement an unconditional-regard intervention in partnership with EU health-care professionals."
705296,"ENgineering DYnamic ViscoElasticity to study cell response","2016","2018","In native tissues, the extracellular matrix (ECM) provides not only physical scaffolding to cells, but also biochemical and biomechanical cues affecting cell behaviour. ECM mechanical properties are critical in the regulation of cell behaviour during tissue development, homeostasis and disease via mechano-transduction. Albeit biological tissues generally exhibit a time variant (i.e. dynamic) viscoelastic behaviour that changes during development, ageing and disease, to date most of mechano-transduction studies have focused on static elastic properties only. The ENDYVE project aims at engineering tissue dynamic viscoelasticity typical of pathophysiological processes in-vivo to investigate its role on cell behaviour. Focusing on cardiomyocyte maturation, the viscoelastic properties of foetal, neonatal, aged and infarcted cardiac tissue will be characterised and used to design cell culture substrates with temporally tuneable mechanical properties that initially mimic foetal viscoelasticity and then can be made more stiff and less viscoelastic during cell culture via a second-step biocompatible enzymatic crosslinking to recapitulate dynamic changes of cardiac viscoelasticity in-vitro. First, stem cell cardiomyocyte behaviour will be investigated at discrete levels of constant viscoelasticity by seeding human induced pluripotent stem cells on substrates prior to and after enzyme-mediated crosslinking. Then the effect of dynamic changes in substrate viscoelasticity will be characterised during culture. Engineering dynamic viscoelasticity is a critical step towards a better understating of cell-ECM interactions and mechano-transduction, and could lead to the development of new strategies to finely control cell behaviour, with numerous potential societal and clinical implication, such as obtaining mature differentiated cells from stem cells for drug screening in vitro, or limiting, if not preventing, fibrosis and tumour progression."

Numerical simulation is increasingly prominent in this field, which forms the natural ground for application of very recent techniques of numerical analysis and scientific computing. In the last decades, the simulation of multiphysics problems, where different models interact to describe a complex phenomenon, has received a lot of interest. The current project is framed in this spirit, with the double aim of advancing in the numerical simulation techniques as well as in the improved understanding of the physics in the application field. As main line of work, we treat mathematical and practical aspects of models for nonlinear poroelasticity, with an emphasis on stable numerical discretizations and the use of fast solvers for the highly efficient solution of the resulting algebraic systems.  Regarding the practical aspects, we focus on the simulation of the deformation of reservoirs during the carbon dioxide injection stage. In this innovative proposal, we also develop efficient methods for uncertainty quantification in order to assess the risks involved in such process and to evaluate the impact on the environment. 
The cooperation between Professors Francisco Gaspar and Cornelis Oosterlee goes back 20 years, when they met (as young and fresh) researchers in FhG SCAI in Germany, and cooperated very successfully on multigrid methods. Then, both researchers went their own way (one in Spain, the other in the Netherlands). Now, both being almost 50 years of age, it is important to cooperate closely again, at Oosterlee’s host institution in the Netherlands. Prof. Gaspar is willing to come over to Amsterdam for two years, to boost the research and open new research directions, such as uncertainty quantification."

Thus, gestures are an important medium for children to understand speakers’ messages (McNeill, 1992). By using behavioural measures, previous studies have revealed that children and adults can comprehend and integrate information from iconic gestures and speech. For example, the Researcher found that it is hard for 3-year-olds to integrate information from speech and co-speech gestures, but 5-year-olds could perform with similar results to adults. However, behavioural measures do not provide access to the underlying neurocognitive processing of speech and iconic gestures, whereas neuroimaging techniques can provide more direct measures of the online cognitive process underlying the comprehension of co-occurring multimodal semantic information. Thus, this project examines neurocognitive processing of semantic information from gesture and speech in children and adults by using neuroimaging techniques such as EEG and fMRI. Study 1 investigates whether iconic gesture and speech are independently or bidirectionally processed in 3- and 5-year-olds and adults. Study 2 examines which brain areas are used to speech and gesture in children and adults. Two contributions are expected from this project. A practical contribution will be providing information to caregivers and teachers about how they should use their gestures to foster childrens’ language acquisition. A theoretical contribution will be providing neurobiological data on how gesture and speech are processed in children and adults. Through this project, the Researcher will obtain knowledge about neuroimaging research and his expertise will contribute to the Host institution by providing knowledge about childrens’ communication research."
705652,"Online DEposition over OceaNs: Modeling the effect of air pollution on ocean bio-geochemistryin an Earth System Model","2016","2018","Iron (Fe) deposition from dust and combustion aerosols is essential for the marine primary productivity in large portions of the world ocean, where phytoplankton growth mitigates part of the anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Under polluted conditions, the atmospheric acidity and organic ligands dramatically enhance aerosol Fe-mobilization, perturbing also the marine CO2 uptake capacity upon aerosol Fe deposition. Air-quality regulations, designed to decrease future atmospheric pollution, will consequently moderate the dissolved Fe deposition flux over oceans and change its pattern. However, the effect of air pollution on the bioavailable Fe supply into the oceans and their primary productivity remains largely ambiguous, with a likely but poorly known climatic impact. The ODEON project will address this long-standing research question by performing for the first time coupled atmosphere-ocean-climate simulations with the European Earth System Model (ESM) EC-Earth, focused on the impacts of Fe deposition on the oceanic carbon-cycle. Recently, important advances were made by the applicant in understanding aerosol Fe dissolution and emission processes. However, ESMs still use simplified parameterizations and asynchronous coupling of Fe supply to the marine biogeochemistry, inserting severe uncertainties in the response of the carbon-cycle to anthropogenic emissions. ODEON aims to improve this situation by developing modelling tools beyond-state-of-the-art, to simulate the atmospheric Fe-cycle in EC-Earth coupled to the embedded ocean biogeochemistry model. The future fellow’s strong atmospheric chemistry modelling background, together with the advanced training-through-research plan on cutting-edge and multi-disciplinary EMS techniques, ensures the feasibility of this project. ODEON’s training scheme in climate modelling, ocean biogeochemistry and interaction with science-users will contribute to the applicant’s development as an independent and interdisciplinary researcher."
705701,"Molecular Evolution of the Primary Structure of Single Chain Polymer Nanoparticles via Dynamic Covalent Chemistry","2016","2018","Cancer continues to be a major cause of death worldwide. While many drugs can reduce the size of tumors, their side effects commonly outweigh their benefits when the drug is administered by conventional methods. One promising approach to overcome this issue is to employ a synthetic enzyme to activate a prodrug into an active drug via a bioorthogonal reaction at the site of a tumor within a patient. Recent work by the group of Prof. E. W. Meijer at the Eindhoven University of Technology on amphiphilic polymers with pendant “sticky” hydrogen bonding moieties and pendant catalytic centers represents state-of-the-art synthetic enzymes. When these polymers are dissolved in dilute aqueous solutions, individual chains fold to form single chain polymer nanoparticles (SCPNs). The folding is thermodynamically driven by hydrophobic interactions and the dynamic aggregation of the “sticky” moieties. Although current SCPNs catalyze bioorthogonal reactions in water, they do not have well-defined high order structure like natural enzymes, instead exhibiting non-cooperative folding and open, elliptical structures. This lack of well-defined high order structure is due to a lack of polymer sequence control, as SCPNs reported to date are random or block copolymers. As a postdoctoral fellow in the Meijer group, I propose to make a new generation of biocompatible SCPNs that feature an aliphatic polycarbonate backbone that undergoes dynamic covalent chemistry in conjunction with the dynamic aggregation of the “sticky” pendant units to “molecularly evolve” the SCPN’s primary structure. This strategy will allow SCPNs to “correct” non-optimal sequences by giving each polymer chain the ability to reshuffle its primary structure, ultimately allowing the SCPNs to achieve lower energy folding states. I predict that the hydrophobic cores of the resulting evolved SCPNs will be more enzyme-like and thus better suited for catalysis and targeted drug therapy applications."
705939,"Landscape of epigenetic control in early and late germ line development","2016","2018","Germ cells have unique role in development. They are the only cells required for the transmission of genetic material from generation to generation in sexually reproducing organisms. This makes them pivotal for the survival of species and ultimately for the propagation of life. Although germ cells undergo extensive cellular differentiation during gametogenesis, they are protected from somatic reprogramming. This requires precise control of transcriptional programs, misregulation of which leads to infertility and developmental defects. Moreover, germ cell-like properties acquired ectopically promote tumor formation. My aim is to understand how germ cell identity is controlled in vertebrates, using zebrafish as a genetic model. My hypothesis is that epigenetic control of gene expression is regulated in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of germ cells. In the nucleus, Polycomb Group (PcG) proteins regulate transcription by establishing repressive chromatin modifications. In the germ cytoplasm, translational regulation by Argonaute proteins, involved in RNA silencing pathways, is pivotal for maintaining germ cell identity. However, the events that facilitate cross-talk between the nucleus and germ cytoplasm are not known. Here, I propose to combine high-end developmental biology techniques with state-of-the art genomic technologies to investigate the cooperation between the PcG complex and Argonaute proteins during germ line development. I believe that the crossing point between my scientific interest (events outside the nucleus) and the expertise of my supervisor (regulation in the nucleus), creates a very solid background for this proposal. It will further develop my interdisciplinary skills and enhance my creative potential by allowing me to look at the regulation of germ cell identity from different angles. I am confident, that this proposal is the perfect stepping stone in becoming an independent scientist and an expert in the field of epigenetic gene regulation."
706349,"Renormalisation Group methods for discrete Quantum Gravity","2016","2018","Understanding quantum gravity requires us to bridge a large gap of scales. The fundamental theory we are searching for is a theory of spacetime at the shortest distances and highest energies. There are many competing proposals for what type of structure best describes this regime. We can not currently generate these high energies in the lab, and hence the most likely method of observing quantum gravity effects are large scale, i.e. astronomical and cosmological observations. To make phenomenological predictions for these large structures, from short scale quantum gravity models, we need to use a renormalisation procedure.

In solid state physics, it is common to use real space renormalisation, in which systems at different sizes are directly related. An example of this is block spin renormalisation of the Ising model, by summarising several spins into one block the system is rescaled, leading to an effective description at larger scales. Applying a similar blocking renormalisation to discrete theories of quantum gravity can help us understand their scaling behaviour. This scaling behaviour can then be used to generalise from small scale simulations to larger scale structures, and to identify universal characteristics arising in these models.

I have much experience in working with discrete gravity systems, using both analytic and computational methods, which the research and training covered in this proposal will allow me to extend.

The host institution, Radboud University in Nijmegen, was chosen for the excellent quality of research. The quantum gravity group led by Professor Loll will provide expert advice, and the strong program of visitors will further enrich the project. The mathematical physics group is comprised of experts in the field of non-commutative geometry, and the proposed research will strengthen the interdisciplinary ties between these groups."
706428,"Temperatures, ash and soil hydrology: predicting fire impact from plant traits","2016","2018","Climate change increases the frequency and intensity of vegetation fires around the world. Fire can considerably increase the landscape’s vulnerability to flooding and erosion, which is in part caused by fire-induced soil damage and hydrological changes. While it is known that plants can alter the fire environment, there is a major knowledge gap regarding the fundamental mechanisms by which vegetation mediates fire impact on soil physics and hydrology. I will address this gap by considering for the first time the cascading effects of plants on fire and soil hydrology, focusing on two important factors in post-fire hydrology: soil heating and ash. My hypothesis is that plant structural and chemical traits vary within the landscape and control fire impact on soil physical properties by affecting heat and ash production. I will test this hypothesis with a combination of spatial sampling, lab experiments and modeling, using contrasting plant species and soils from watersheds in Portugal and the USA. Multiple regression and principal component analysis will be used to relate fire impacts to the various plant traits. This project can help predict and mitigate fire risk and impact across landscapes, facilitate development of risk maps, and generate knowledge with implications for nature conservation, land use planning, fire management and potential policy making. Aside from helping safeguard soil and (drinking) water resources, the project can also change a European braindrain into a braingain, supporting reintegration of a successful interdisciplinary scientist and her large network after three years in the USA. Additional benefits for Europe include transfer of knowledge gained in the USA and knowledge exchange from southern to northern member states. Through training and research, this project will enhance my success of getting a permanent position in academia and create new opportunities to incorporate hydrology and scale in above-belowground interaction research."
706443,"Wnt Enhancer LandscapE CharacTerization","2016","2018","Despite significant efforts, cancer remains one of the major health challenges in Europe.
In essence, cancer can be seen as the result of alterations in the intricate balance between cell proliferation, differentiation and death during tissue homeostasis. Hence, pathways that are essential for the development and maintenance of mammalian tissues are frequently deregulated in human tumors and represent attractive targets for therapeutic intervention.
In that respect, the Wnt signal transduction pathway serves as a paradigm: On the one hand, Wnt ligands are crucial determinants of cell fate decisions and can act as self-renewal factors for adult stem cells in multiple tissues, including the mammary gland. On the other hand, aberrant activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway is a hallmark of many human (breast) tumors.
While it is clear that Wnt activity has to be carefully coordinated in precise temporal and tissue-specific patterns, there is a significant knowledge gap regarding the underlying control mechanisms.
In this project, I will combine bioinformatics, state-of-the-art genome engineering and an innovative screening approach to identify Wnt-associated enhancers in the mammary gland.
I aim to:
1. Establish an effective experimental pipeline for an epigenetic screen.
2. Identify functional regulatory sequences for almost half of the mammalian Wnt genes.
3. Validate individual enhancers in vivo.
The proposed research together with the training I will receive in an excellent, multidisciplinary research environment will significantly benefit my scientific career development.
Finally, I envisage that my results will provide the basis for uncovering how environmental and intrinsic signals are integrated to control dynamic Wnt expression patterns in both normal development and cancer."
706899,"Equidae Hindgut Anaerobic Fungi: A key unexplored taxa of central importance to dietary fibre degradation","2016","2018","EQUIANFUN is a strategic research and training alliance I have assembled to catalyse the development of my new career path in comparative herbivore gut microbiology, and addresses a major nutritional challenge facing the equine community. The hindgut microbiota of equines enables forage utilisation; however, the limited efficiency of this process currently requires that the diets of many equines are supplemented with energy-dense concentrates in order to meet their dietary energy requirements. This practice can disturb the equine hindgut microbiota, resulting in the development of gut-mediated diseases which are a major health and welfare issue and economic cost to the equine community. Despite the fact that anaerobic fungi (AF) are the most effective of the fibre-degrading gut microbes, they have been largely overlooked in equine gut microbiology studies to date. Therefore research into this under-explored area will significantly advance the ability to increase the efficiency of forage utilisation in equines, minimising the need for concentrate supplements. Drawing on my core skills base, and utilising internationally leading expertise and facilities in gut microbiomics and animal nutrition at Wageningen University, EQUIANFUN establishes new baseline knowledge of the phylogeny, community structure, physiology and nutritional impact of equine hindgut AF. In addition to generating top quality research findings of applied impact, EQUIANFUN deepens my skills and competencies whilst broadening my research expertise and network beyond its current rumen focus. Furthermore the integrated role of the two partner organisations, Utrecht University and the Donkey Sanctuary, widens the scope of EQUIANFUN to also include the health and welfare of all domesticated equids. In summary, EQUIANFUN is pivotal to the development of my new career path and ability to attain professional maturity as an internationally leading researcher in comparative herbivore gut microbiology."

The acquisition and transfer of knowledge and skills will take place through the execution of a research project, the participation in specific training activities and the involvement of the researcher into the research, teaching and management activities of the Knowledge Center Open Data of Delft University of Technology. The Knowledge Center Open Data, established in 2012, brings together research and practice to tackle different organizational and legal issues regarding the availability of public spatial data. The proposed research project of the fellowship will examine the impact of different models for governing open spatial data on the performance of open spatial data policies in Europe. A case study approach will be implemented, analyzing two countries that are among the leading open data countries in the world: the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. The project will be executed in close collaboration with the Dutch Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations, the public authority responsible for the implementation of the open government agenda in the Netherlands, and the Open Data Institute in the United Kingdom, one of the pioneering bodies in Europe in the field of open data. The expected new insights in the performance of the governance models will allow public administrations to optimize their governance model of open spatial data to further the societal impact of open data policies. The project will pay particular attention to the communication of the research results towards non-experts and the wider public, explaining the value and relevance of open spatial data to government, businesses, citizens and society in general."
707229,"Aptamer nanostructures dual-targeted to the HER receptor family for cancer therapy","2016","2018","The proposed research programme deals with the development of aptamer nanostructures for targeted cancer therapy. Immunotherapy encompasses a growing field of anti-cancer therapeutics that target cancer cells expressing specific antigens, such as members of the HER receptor. Currently, immunoglobulins directed to HER1, better known as EGFR, and HER2 are used in the clinical management of several types of cancer. There are, however, several disadvantages associated with the production and application of immunoglobulins. Moreover, there is evidence that dual-targeting of multiple receptors at the same time is advantageous for improving clinical outcome and reducing drug resistance. Aptamers, which are short single-stranded oligonucleotides that can bind a target molecule in a similar fashion as immunoglobulins, may form, due to their physicochemical properties, a superior alternative strategy for targeted cancer therapy. In ADHERE, I will design (WP1) and investigate in vitro (WP2) and in vivo (WP3) the use of aptamer nanostructures with bispecific (against both EGFR and HER2) and multivalent (up to 4 binding ligands) targeting properties for cancer cell targeting.
The 24-month research project will be executed at the department of Polymer Chemistry and Bioengineering at the Zernike Institute for Advanced Materials, University of Groningen, The Netherlands. The aim of this MSCA IF fellowship is to integrate my extensive background in targeted drug delivery and cellular therapeutics within the host institute, which is highly experienced with DNA nanomaterials and is positioned among the top 10 institutes of the world in the field of material science. 
Importantly, this fellowship will strengthen my career perspectives, by allowing me to gain valuable new transferable skills and receive additional high-level training. This will enable me to position myself as a leading young scientist in the field of clinical nanomaterials."
707362,"microRNAs in susceptibility to traumatic stress","2016","2018","Traumatic stressors are important and prevalent risk factors for psychiatric disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). People differ strikingly in their susceptibility to develop PTSD after traumatic stress, however the exact underlying biological mechanisms of differential susceptibility are unknown. The identification of biomarkers that distinguish between persons at high and low risk of developing PTSD following trauma exposure would enable more effective preventive strategies and early interventions. Epigenetic mechanisms have been proposed to underlie the relationship between exposure to traumatic stress and the susceptibility to develop PTSD. Recent work carried out by the host laboratory demonstrated that DNA methylation might regulate the impact of traumatic stress on gene expression and ultimately brain function. Based on this and the emerging role of miRNA as key epigenetic players in psychiatric disorders, I hypothesize that (i) susceptibility to traumatic stress exposure is associated with distinct miRNAs expression profiles with blood-brain correlation, (ii) experimental manipulation of miRNA expression levels in animals alters their susceptibility to traumatic stress. These hypotheses will be tested by a unique set of epigenetic epidemiological studies using prospective cohorts with longitudinal sampling schemes of military soldiers deployed to war, next to experimental animal studies. The proposed multidisciplinary and translational project will open the possibility of tapping into the mechanisms underlying differential susceptibility to traumatic stress through blood profiling. It has excellent prospects for yielding clinically relevant and usable biomarkers for the prediction of susceptibility to traumatic stressors. Moreover, the project will reinforce my foundation as a highly promising early career researcher by broadening my knowledge, skills, professional experience and network necessary to launch my own research group."
707364,"Nanomechanical spin-to-photon transduction in silicon","2016","2018","The spin of an electron trapped in the binding potential of a phosphorous donor has recently shown some of the longest quantum coherence times in solid state and is now regarded as one of the most promising materials for quantum computing. However, current readout techniques rely on single-electron transistors for which millikelvin temperatures and nanoelectronic connections are needed.
 
We propose to establish a new transduction mechanism that coherently couples silicon spin qubits to optical photons at the quantum level and hence provides optical addressing at 4K temperatures. Central to our proposed quantum transducer is a nanomechanical resonator, that acts as a conduit of quantum information. We will realize sufficiently strong interactions between the resonator and both spins and photons by exploiting nanophotonic systems, which can confine light fields and mechanical motion at the nanoscale.
 
Our objectives are to show: (i) coupling between the spin and the mechanics by inducing spin-dependent mechanical frequency shift and read this out optically, and (ii) pulsed backaction-evading measurements of nanomechanical motion, establishing a fast single-shot qubit readout method, and allowing the creation of non-classical mechanical states through projective measurement.
 
Doing this we create a unique three-way hybrid quantum system: spin qubit–mechanical resonator–optical cavity. The study of this new “spin-optomechanics” system is expected to both contribute to the exploration of the size-frontiers of quantum mechanics and lead to advancements in the field of quantum computation as well as ultra-sensitive magnetometry.
 
The project allows the applicant to gain crucial expertise in nano-optomechanics and nanophotonics. Combined with his previous experience on spin qubits, the proposed research and the excellent scientific host environment will arm him with a unique skill set that will position him well for a future research position in Europe."
707727,"Audiovisual Speech Segmentation and Oscillations","2016","2018","Daily social tasks (e.g. meetings, shopping) rely on human communication with speech. Auditory only studies established that continuous speech segmentation relies on the temporal integration of rhythmic acoustic features occurring at delta-theta rates in the signal, via a possible mechanism of entrainment coupled with beta activity. In terms of neural correlates, the timing network (including the basal ganglia, supplementary motor area and cerebellum) may actively contribute to the temporal integration of auditory signal during continuous speech segmentation. However, speech is often multimodal and listeners need to integrate speaker’s body movements aligned to rhythmic acoustic features. Consequently, AV speech may generate different rhythmic patterns than auditory only speech. How the brain translates naturally concomitant AV rhythms to facilitate speech segmentation clearly remains to be addressed. The goal of this project is to investigate the oscillatory patterns and neural correlates of AV rhythms resulting from the temporal integration of body movements and salient acoustic features in speech. In a first EEG experiment, I will compare the modulations of delta-theta entrainment and coupling with beta activity, depending on the relationship between visual and auditory information (congruent, incongruent and auditory only). Secondly, in an fMRI version of the experiment, I will explore the contribution of the timing network during AV speech segmentation, and its different patterns of activations across speech conditions. Finally, to test whether the brain areas revealed by fMRI have a necessary role for the successful AV speech segmentation, I will run the same fMRI experiment with Parkinson’s disease patients with dysfunctional basal ganglia. Looking at the timing network patterns of activations will also reveal if correlated body information eventually help PD to compensate basal ganglia deficit with greater contribution of alternative path (i.e. cerebellum)."
707865,"Enhancing expectancy formation in healthy aging through statistical and sensorimotor learning","2016","2018","My research examines how humans form new expectancies, or states of anticipation for future events, and how expectancy formation changes over the lifespan. Humans constantly anticipate upcoming events in order to understand those events, prepare actions, and adapt to changes. Although the neural and behavioral signatures of expectancies have been well-characterized, we do not know how they arise and how they change over the lifespan. I aim to reveal the following: 1) How new expectancies are formed during the course of learning novel information. 2) How expectancy formation differs between younger and older adults. 3) How the combination of regularities in event structure and sensorimotor integration, a phenomenon that has not been investigated, potentiates expectancy formation. 4) The role of interacting subcortical-cortical neural networks in expectancy formation. I will monitor the dynamic changes in electrophysiological brain responses, as well as overt anticipatory behaviour, over the course of learning in order to capture the changes of anticipatory responses online, and I will apply Bayesian neural network modelling to infer the neural and cognitive state changes underlying these response changes. I will also measure changes in subcortical-cortical networks that result from learning, including structural integrity, functional connectivity, and the ability to decode the learned information. This multi-methods approach will utilize my expertise in behavioural and MRI methods combined with my research group's expertise in EEG and computational modelling, as well as the state-of-the-art EEG, MRI, and laboratory facilities, on-site expertise, and support staff available at Maastricht University. This research is urgently needed so that we can finally understand the origin of expectancies, their consequences on the aging brain, and how we can enhance their formation to improve lifelong learning."

In particular, the research project will model and analyze the economics of the upstream fermentation and downstream purification operations. Novel approximations and heuristics will be developed based on the unique features of the problem setting in order to solve large size problems encountered in industry practices. Optimal (near-optimal) operating policies will be theoretically and numerically analyzed for both upstream fermentation and downstream chromatography operating decisions. The framework will provide timely and effective tools and models to economically optimize biomanufacturing decisions.

709077,"Miniaturised Metabolomics Platform for Microvascular Research","2016","2018","Preventing and treating progressive microvascular loss (i.e. rarefaction) is a major challenge in cardiovascular medicine. Microvascular disease is a multifactorial disease with no effective treatment. Long-term exposure to adverse metabolic and haemodynamic conditions such as hypertension, obesity and diabetes can cause microvascular destabilisation, loss of tissue capillaries, and eventual organ failure. Interestingly, not all diabetic patients develop kidney failure. The missing link to developing effective strategies for treating multifactorial diseases, including microvascular disease, is detailed mechanistic insight into the relationship between disease pathogenesis at the organ/cellular level at the systemic/organism level. 
This project, METAFORA, aims to develop novel and analytical technologies to allow a new approach to understand the pathology of microvascular disease. METAFORA will develop a miniaturized metabolomics workflow to study metabolic pathways in an in-vitro microfluidic 3D microvasculature platform with organotypic functionality (the so-called organ-on-a-chip) to create personalised in-vitro models based on patient-derived human cells. This platform will enable the assessment of biochemical disease processes at the cell/organ level in the ‘whole-patient’ context by perfusing the patient’s own blood through the vasculature model.
METAFORA will use and optimize a novel separation and preconcentration method, depletion zone isotachophoresis, for the miniaturised analytical platform, which will be combined with mass spectrometry for metabolite profiling."

One of the most objective and reliable tests is eyeblink conditioning, as it is extremely simple, it can be done in both humans and animals, it measures many aspects of how we learn in our daily life, and it can detect memory deficits in many neurological and psychiatric diseases. However, so far there are no low-cost reliable eyeblink conditioning setups commercially available. Therefore, we propose for this ERC-POC application to prepare the commercialization of ErasmusBlink as a low-cost, wearable eyeblink conditioning recording and analysis setup that can be used in virtually all species. With ErasmusBlink one can do reliable and reproducible eyeblink conditioning experiments for scientific, medical and industrial purposes. ErasmusBlink will be the first ‘total care’ package, alleviating the potential customer from the requirement of the technical and programming skills, which one currently needs to acquire before being able to do eyeblink conditioning experiments. Our market survey will cover three major fields: Basic neurosciences (1), clinical and pharmaceutical research (2), and nutritional sciences (3). For all three fields eyeblink conditioning parameters have been shown to uncover important and fundamental functional processes and correlations. Our current academic collaborations with key players in each of these disciplines and with industrial partners like Noldus IT serve as a solid platform to ensure a successful commercialization of ErasmusBlink."

An existing half model will be adapted with an UHBR nacelle and for the application of Active Flow Control (AFC) systems at the upper side of the wing near the wing pylon interface in order to improve the high lift performance of the configuration. The application of AFC is considered in order to diminish the detrimental effects of applying a large nacelle in close proximity of the wing, necessitating a slat cutback. Different AFC systems will be installed and tested: a Pulsed Jet Actuator (PJA), a Synthetic Jet Actuator (SJA) and a Steady Blowing (SB) device. Each will be tested at two different positions. Low speed tests (Ma=0.1 to 0.3) need to be made at representatively high Reynolds number. With the target half model sufficiently high Reynolds number (Re based on mean aerodynamic chord) can only be obtained in a highly pressurized wind tunnel or in a cryogenic facility. The DNW-KKK cryogenic wind tunnel has been selected for the test. 
Overall model forces will be measured and local influence of the AFC systems needs to be monitored, using surface streamline pattern visualization with mini-tufts, complemented with detailed PIV measurements of the separated flow and flow topology over the wing downstream of the wing pylon/nacelle interface."

The company’s strength has traditionally lied in electronic structure methods, its flagship product being the well-known ADF package. In recent years SCM has been broadening its scope to add approximate, faster methods. One of such methods is the COnductor-like Screening MOdel for Realistic Solvation, COSMO-RS, a powerful continuum solvation model.
COSMO-RS is able to predict thermodynamic properties in solutions in an efficient and general way, and has proven to be one of the modules with the fastest-growing demand within SCM’s portfolio – the company’s revenues from COSMO-RS have increased almost 130% over the last two years. COSMO-RS is therefore a key component of SCM’s growth strategy.
However, our COSMO-RS implementation has one important limitation, as it cannot deal with molecular models above a certain size. And the ability to predict thermodynamic properties in larger molecules, and in particular polymers, is of great relevance in many areas (e.g. food packaging, coating technology, membrane separation and drug development). SCM therefore plans to extend its COSMO-RS implementation to allow for molecular models of any size, in order to increase our market share in the field of polymer chemistry.
There are several possible routes to accomplish that (such as fragment-based methods or equations of state (EOS) approaches) but they all require a level of expertise in thermodynamics and continuum models currently lacking within SCM. This is highly specialized work, which falls outside SCM’s strengths in electronic structure methods, and the company needs to recruit skills combining expertise in continuum solvation models as well as modern software development techniques.
Such developments would extend the market for SCM’s COSMO-RS implementation, allowing the company to tap into the huge market of polymer chemistry."

PROMINENT thereby is fully in line with the objectives of the European action programme NAIADES-II. PROMINENT addresses all topics included in call MG.4.4-2014 and is geared towards reaching its full impacts during the project lifetime. PROMINENT is ultimately aimed at providing solutions which make inland navigation as competitive as road transport in terms of air pollutant emissions by 2020 and beyond. In parallel PROMINENT aims to further decrease the energy consumption and carbon footprint of IWT, an area where IWT has already a strong advantage compared to road transport. PROMINENT will focus on:

• Massive transition towards efficient and clean vessels.
• Certification and monitoring of emission performance and development of innovative regimes.
• Harmonisation and modernisation of professional qualifications and the stimulation of the further integration of IWT into sustainable transport chains.

PROMINENT will achieve the following targets:

- Develop cost-effective solutions applicable to 70% of the fleet and reduce the implementation costs by 30%;
- Involve all relevant stakeholders;
- Actively address and remove implementation barriers by 2020.

The PROMINENT partners have found broad support among political and commercial decision makers in the field of inland navigation. Through its direct access to relevant industrial stakeholders and Member States the consortium has obtained significant backup needed to perform the work.

It is called “PROMINENT – Promoting Innovation in the Inland Waterways Transport Sector” and will address the key needs for technological development, as well as the barriers to innovation and greening in the European inland navigation sector. PROMINENT thereby is fully in line with the objectives of the European action programme NAIADES-II. PROMINENT addresses all topics included in call MG.4.4-2014 and is geared towards reaching its full impacts during the project lifetime. PROMINENT is ultimately aimed at providing solutions which make inland navigation as competitive as road transport in terms of air pollutant emissions by 2020 and beyond. In parallel PROMINENT aims to further decrease the energy consumption and carbon footprint of IWT, an area where IWT has already a strong advantage compared to road transport. PROMINENT will focus on:

• Massive transition towards efficient and clean vessels.
• Certification and monitoring of emission performance and development of innovative regimes
• Harmonisation and modernisation of professional qualifications and the stimulation of the further integration of IWT into sustainable transport chains.

PROMINENT will achieve the following targets:

- develop cost-effective solutions applicable to 70% of the fleet and reduce the implementation costs by 30%;
- involve all relevant stakeholders;
- actively address and remove implementation barriers by 2020.

The PROMINENT partners have found broad support among political and commercial decision makers in the field of inland navigation. Through its direct access to relevant industrial stakeholders and Member States the consortium has obtained significant backup needed to perform the work. The commitment of these organisations will lead to a high acceptance and further dissemination of  results."

Sensorineural hearing loss due to loss of auditory hair cells was long thought to be irreversible. However, recent animal studies have demonstrated that pharmacological inhibition of cell signalling via Notch receptors using gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) can regenerate hair cells and partially restore hearing capacity. This novel therapeutic concept provides the first promising lead for actual treatment of hearing loss. Clinical validation of these findings is the next crucial stepping stone in the development of a regenerative therapy for hearing loss. The ambition of REGAIN is to repurpose a GSI molecule for this indication by shifting from systemic to local treatment.
The objective of the REGAIN project is to demonstrate and exploit the efficacy of locally administered GSIs to improve hearing through regeneration of inner ear hair cells with a lasting effect. The project will involve 1) the upscaling of GMP production of the clinical GSI candidate, 2) the generation of preclinical data on GSI dosing and local safety, 3) medical ethical clinical trial approval and 4) the demonstration of proof of concept for GSI for treatment of patients with recent onset sensorineural hearing loss. 
Small molecule drugs targeting the underlying biological causes of hearing loss in a safe way are expected to meet a real medical need for millions of patients, who currently rely on the limited benefits provided by hearing aids or cochlear implants. The partners involved in REGAIN represent the current state of the art in regenerative hearing loss research in the EU. REGAIN will break through that current state of the art, and will advance the first highly promising pharmaceutical treatment of hearing loss through clinical testing."

Prevention of youth smoking is crucial to any strategy aimed at reducing this disease burden in the future. Several potentially effective strategies and programs are available to address youth smoking. However, in practice their impact often appears to be limited, especially among socially disadvantaged youth. 
There is very little systematic evidence on HOW smoking prevention strategies and programs worked in practice, and WHY some programs seemed to influence youth smoking only in some settings or groups. Yet, such evidence is urgently needed to enable decision makers to use the resources available for smoking prevention in the most effective and equitable way.
We will generate such evidence by addressing these HOW and WHY questions in a comparative approach. For Finland, Ireland, Germany, Netherlands, Belgium, Italy and Portugal, we aim to assess HOW strategies and programs to prevent smoking in national and local settings affected smoking behaviour of 16 year olds. Moreover, we aim to assess HOW and WHY this impact varied according to city, school, gender, and socioeconomic group.
We will be among the first to apply the approach of “realist evaluation” to the evaluation of preventive programs, and to use this innovative approach to compare European countries. We will acquire primary data that are comparable across these countries, including a quantitative survey among 10,000\ students, and in-depth structured interviews with students and various stakeholders. 
We expect to make a major contribution to the reduction of disease burden and health inequalities among future elderly populations. We will apply a new method for learning from different countries, and for generating the fine-grained evidence that is needed to develop youth smoking prevention programs that are context-sensitive, cost-effective and equity-oriented."

The process makes use of high pressure CO2 technology as drying medium which enables efficient drying at close-to-ambient temperatures in absence of oxygen. Research and development studies have shown it feasibility of being an ecological and economical alternative to freeze-drying, for products categories vegetables and fruits, specialty ingredients such as proteins and biopolymers. Besides good preservation of a food quality, microbial inactivation occurs in situ which attributes to ensuring food safety. 

The main objectives are: (i) minimize risks that could prevent CO2 drying to enter the market and (ii) to demonstrate its market replication potential via a first application to the market. 

The base of the project is to provide on the one hand prototyped products and on the other prototyped process extensions that will increase the market potential. Prototyping processing elements will demonstrate the energy reduction of the process and the full width of applications at a pilot scale. By preparing three product prototypes the aim is to demonstrate the full potential of this technology to the industry at a foodgrade level, resulting in validation of the process.

On the basis of the prototype assessments, in close conjunction with industrial (SME) parties, the process will be certified, (economically) validated and demonstrated to the industry. The final step is demonstrating the process in a near-operational environment to identify all the benefits for consumer and the food chain. 
By doing so, the drying process will evolve from a TRL 4-5 to a TRL 8. By intensive dissemination to increase visibility, the technology will disseminated to SME’s in Europe to maximize uptake of the technology in the market and realizating impact on sustainability, food safety and economy."

However, trends in safety performance over the last decade indicate that the ACARE Vision 2020 safety goal of an 80% reduction of the accident rate is not being achieved. A stronger focus on safety is required. There is a need to start a Joint Research Programme (JRP) on Aviation Safety, aiming for Coordinated Safety Research as well as Safety Research Coordination. The proposed JRP Safety, established under coordination of EREA, is built on European safety priorities, around four main themes with each theme consisting of a small set of projects.  Theme 1 (New solutions for today’s accidents) aims for breakthrough research with the purpose of enabling a direct, specific, significant risk reduction in the medium term. Theme 2 (Strengthening the capability to manage risk) conducts research on processes and technologies to enable the aviation system actors to achieve near-total control over the safety risk in the air transport system. Theme 3 (Building ultra-resilient systems and operators) conducts research on the improvement of Systems and the Human Operator with the specific aim to improve safety performance under unanticipated circumstances. Theme 4 (Building ultra-resilient vehicles), aims at reducing the effect of external hazards on the aerial vehicle integrity, as well as improving the safety of the cabin environment. To really connect and drive complementary Safety R&D (by EREA) to safety priorities as put forward in the EASA European Aviation Safety plan (EASp) and the EC ACARE Strategic Research and Innovation (RIA)Agenda, Safety Research Coordination activities are proposed. Focus on key priorities that impact the safety level most will significantly increase the leverage effect of the complementary safety Research and Innovation actions planned and performed by EREA."
641456,"Breeding Invertebrates for Next Generation BioControl (BINGO)","2015","2018","BACKGROUND
Secure and sustainable food production in terms of quantity and quality is a major challenge facing human societies. However, food security is continuously threatened by current and invasive pest species. EU regulations for the use of pesticides are getting stricter to ensure food safety and protect ecosystem health. Biocontrol of agricultural pests by using natural enemies has great potential to deal with these two demands.
CHALLENGE
Controlling novel exotic pests often involves importing non-native natural enemies. Such practices are undesirable as it poses risks to local biodiversity. Optimizing existing and native biocontrol agents can reduce the dependence on imported natural enemies.
OBJECTIVE
BINGO will advance current knowledge in biocontrol practice through the use of natural genetic variation and by simultaneously training 13 young researchers in an extensive suite of interdisciplinary skills. This will allow them to improve the efficiency of biological pest control through selective breeding of natural enemies in a broad range of agricultural systems and environmental conditions.
HOW
The research projects will address current bottlenecks in biocontrol, for rearing, monitoring and performance, that include a broad range of scientific disciplines and in which state-of-the-art population genomics will be applied. Industry has a pivotal role by providing the problems for research, training, and by translating the results to capacity building and increased competitiveness.
RELEVANCE
BINGO will deliver improved biocontrol agents, knowledge on the genetic organisation of traits related to agents’ performance, genetic markers for monitoring and risk assessment, and guidelines and protocols for genetic improvement of natural enemies. Crucially, BINGO will deliver eager ESRs that have the potential to thrive in professional environments in science, industry and public bodies to ensure that the biocontrol potential is met and implemented."
641459,"RELIability of product Environmental Footprints","2015","2018","To move towards a more sustainable world there needs to be a systematic change in the consumption of resources driven by informed decision-making and policies. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is widely accepted as a tool for supporting decisions on environmental footprints. However, it is also acknowledged that the reliability of state-of-the-art LCA needs to be improved as uncertainty and variability are generally not addressed. The importance of improving the reliability of environmental footprinting is currently recognised in the Product Environmental Footprinting approach and in the recommendations of the European Resource Efficiency Platform. This European Industrial Doctorate proposal (RELIEF), a cooperation between Radboud University and Unilever as partners and the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Stanford University, University of Surrey, Ostfold Research, GreenDelta and the International Union for Conservation of Nature as associate partners, offers a unique international and multidisciplinary training environment for early-stage researchers (ESRs) to improve the reliability of the environmental footprinting of products. RELIEF will develop new models to reduce uncertainty throughout the value chain. Developing these models requires a multidisciplinary approach. Four ESRs will work on different topics, i.e. improving the reliability of product footprints related to energy (carbon), land, chemicals and water. The fifth ESR will work on macro-scale environmental models, in order to incorporate cross-cutting issues from the other four ESRs. Each ESR will receive  broad, high-level training in scientific and general skills as well as personalized training. The training will be delivered by a combination of courses, as part of their own research and via learning in business and academia. The RELIEF project will deliver not only novel methods, but also researchers with state of the art skills and environmental footprinting knowledge."
641665,"The next generation epigenetic medicine for inflammation","2015","2018","Epigenetic mechanisms allow cells to adjust gene expression in response to environmental cues. Increased understanding of this area has led to excitement about the potential of applying epigenetic regulation to drug discovery. EPIMAC aims to pursue the potential of epigenetics as a novel and innovative therapeutic modality for immuno-inflammatory diseases, in particular Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). 
IBD is a severe and disabling chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract affecting millions of people worldwide. Current treatment strategies are not successful because the precise etiology unclear. It is increasingly clear that deregulated epigenetic processes are associated with the aberrant inflammatory response seen in IBD. Recent reports suggest that inhibitors of epigenetic modifications developed by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), such as histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, bear potential in treating inflammatory states (Nicodeme et al, Nature 2010; Kruidenier et al, Nature 2012). 
The EPIMAC consortium has the ambition to educate a group of next-generation scientists that master genetics, epigenetics, target discovery, pharmacology, preclinical validation and regulatory issues, and at the same time have a good understanding of clinical implementations of the drug pipeline of our pharmaceutical partner GSK. GSK is one of the world's leading research-based pharmaceutical and healthcare companies that aims to team up with academic partners in EPIMAC through its dedicated discovery performance unit named EpiNova in conjunction with 2  immuno-pharmacology units. An SME specializing in epigenetic compound targeting to inflammatory cells, Chroma Therapeutics, will contribute technology to EPIMAC. EPIMAC will educate and train these scientists by providing them with a versatile and multidisciplinary doctoral program, allowing them to become excellent scientists skilled to overcome the current challenges in IBD."
641833,"ONCOgenic Receptor Network of Excellence and Training","2015","2018","Cancer is a leading health concern. There is a need to fully understand the fundamental processes underlying development of cancer. There is increasing evidence that G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and their associated signalling cascades are involved in both cancer progression and metastasis. As oncogenic GPCRs are likely to be amenable to manipulation via drugs they are ideal therapeutic targets. In ONCORNET (Oncogenic Receptor Network of Excellence and Training) we propose to target two oncogenic GPCRs; the chemokine receptors CXCR4 and CXCR7. These are highly expressed in a range of tumours and yet their role in cancer progression is not well understood. We will focus on unravelling how CXCR4 and CXCR7 are or can be modulated (small molecules, pepducins, nanodies) and investigate the effects on oncogenic responses. This represents crucial knowledge that we currently do not have and yet may well provide potential leads for drug development and commercialisation. ONCORNET will bring together the leading research scientists and labs in Europe with an interest in GPCRs and 15 early stage researchers. We will employ all the latest multidisciplinary research technologies to understand the role of these GPCRs in cancer and develop CXCR4 and CXCR7 tools for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Importantly, developed approaches can be extrapolated to other oncogenic GPCRs. The ONCORNET consortium will offer an extensive multidisciplinary training programme to the ESRs to ensure that they can operate in today’s drug discovery programmes. This will include both research (e.g. drug discovery, proteomics, imaging, modelling) and transferable (e.g. entrepreneurship, writing, media training) skill sets –that is rarely offered at PhD level. We will train ESRs to develop the next generation of multidisciplinary scientists with skills that are highly demanded by many of today’s employers in drug development industries."

In total 13 Early Stage Researchers will be recruited within the Photo4Future network. The network will provide them with opportunities to undertake research with the aim to overcome the current limitations towards the applicability and scalability of photochemical transformations. This will be achieved through a rational design of novel photocatalytic methodologies, improved catalytic systems and innovative photoreactors. Furthermore, the ESRs will be trained in the Photo4Future graduate school, covering training in scientific, personal and complementary skills. All the ESRs will perform two secondments, of which at least one is carried out with an industrial partner. Consequently, the ESRs will have improved career prospects and a higher employability. Due to the high degree of industrial participation, the Photo4Future network will provide an innovation-friendly environment where scientific results can grow and become products or services that will benefit European economies."

642682,"Airborne Wind Energy System Modelling, Control and Optimisation","2015","2018","The height of conventional wind turbines is limited by the enormous stresses on the structure. The idea of the Airborne Wind Energy (AWE) is to replace the most efficient part of a conventional wind turbine, the tip of the turbine blade, with a fast flying high efficiency kite, and to replace the rest of the structure by a tether which anchors the kite to the ground. Power is generated either by periodically pulling a ground based generator via a winch, or by small wind turbines mounted on the kite that exploit its fast cross wind motion. While the concept is highly promising, major academic and industrial research is still needed to achieve the performance required for industrial deployment. This can best be done by innovative junior researchers in a closely cooperating consortium of academic and industrial partners.
The ITN AWESCO combines six interdisciplinary academic and four industrial network partners with seven associated partners, all selected on the basis of excellence and complementarity. All partners work already intensively on AWE systems, several with prototypes, and they are committed to create synergies via the cooperation in AWESCO. The main task is to train fourteen Early Stage Researchers (ESRs) in training-by-research and to create a closely connected new generation of leading European scientists that are ready to push the frontiers of airborne wind energy.
AWESCO is the first major cooperation effort of the most important European actors in the field and will help Europe to gain a leading role in a possibly huge emerging renewable energy market, and to meet its ambitious CO2 targets. In addition, the AWESCO early stage researchers will be trained in cutting-edge simulation, design, sensing, and control technologies that are needed in many branches of engineering."

Given the frequent Tamoxifen treatment failure, resistance prevention and reversal is an urgent clinical problem that is central in EpiPredict. The EpiPredict intersectorial training programme employs a timely systems medicine approach combining next-generation systematic epigenetic, gene/protein profiling with innovative gene-specific epigenetic interference technologies for iterative computational modelling. Together the ESRs will identify key epigenetic changes underlying Tamoxifen induced resistance. This will provide an important step towards diagnostic markers/tools to predict treatment outcome and response monitoring setting the scene for breast cancer personalized medicine. The fellows will be trained by experts from 6 academic and 2 non-academic beneficiaries and 7 partner organizations (1 academic, 6 non-academic including industrial/socio-public parties) and 5 visiting scientists, from fields ranging from epigenetics to both computation and medicine. Strong involvement of the private sector ensures exploitation of EpiPredict achievements and exposure of the ESRs to an entrepreneurial mindset. 
The cohort of supradisciplinary researchers represents a new generation of research leaders equipped to address complex diseases whilst taking personalized patient aspects into consideration. They will be equipped to compete successfully and succeed in their personal careers. EpiPredict will boost academia and pharma/biotech environments, providing extra impulses to drive European translational science, systems medicine, pharmaceutical industry, and Medical ICT offering ample job opportunities."

Because strong evidence exists that metabolic cell-to-cell heterogeneity has, for instance, disease relevance, researcher from MetaRNA will overcome this severe analytical limitation through exploiting exciting opportunities emerging from the RNA field. Such synergy potential between the metabolism and RNA research fields has until today not been exploited, because they are separated from each other in Europe and worldwide. Through consequently missing research training programs we thus lack experts with combined knowledge in metabolism and RNA. The aim of the MetaRNA proposal is therefore to establish a European Training Network (ETN) that educates specialists for academia and industry - fully trained at the interface of these two fields - in the development and application of RNA-based sensors to investigate metabolism at the single-cell level, to apply these tools for novel biotechnological applications and to provide a framework for their future use in diagnostics and therapeutics. In MetaRNA, eight research groups from the metabolic and RNA fields and six partners from the private sector join forces to create a platform of mobility and training to 15 early-stage researchers (ESRs), by means of customized research projects, exchange of knowhow among researchers and partners, attendance to specialized courses, workshops and conferences, as well as training in complementary skills."

Three early stage researchers will be trained at the cutting edge of PhD science and enterprise research and development, allowing access for the PhD research program to the best possible equipment while helping the early stage researchers to learn in practise what it takes to convert a rough design into a viable commercial product. In addition to forming this unique and exciting means of early stage researcher training within the European Industrial Doctorate program, the academic and mass spectrometry community as a whole will benefit from a new and stable supplier of advanced technologies."
642836,"Engineering of new-generation protein secretion systems","2015","2018","The market for recombinant proteins, including biopharmaceuticals, industrial enzymes and membrane proteins, is estimated to be about 78 billion Euro and rising. A high proportion of the target proteins are produced in bacteria, where secretion out of the cytoplasm is a favoured strategy. However, current production platforms have severe limitations and cannot handle many secreted enzymes and membrane proteins. There is an overwhelming need for new production systems that can deliver these products in greater yields, with higher quality and at lower costs. The 'ProteinFactory' ETN will meet these challenges through the provision of a suite of super-secreting strains with unique capabilities. These strains will be engineered to bypass major production bottlenecks such as secretion stress, and will be capable of secreting an unprecedented range of target molecules. Equally important will be the training of a new generation of researchers, versed in Systems and Synthetic Biology approaches. The ProteinFactory project will involve extensive collaboration between 6 academic Institutes, who provide world-leading expertise in synthetic biology and protein secretion, and 5 non-academic partners who include some of the world's premier biotechnology companies. Training will be inter-sectoral from the outset, with every ESR undertaking extensive secondments within the non-academic partners in order to encourage an entrepreneurial mind-set. The project is furthermore explicitly multi-disciplinary in scope, with two of the five research work packages dominated by theoretical approaches. Based on a responsible innovation approach and with a clear focus on inter-sectoral collaboration, ProteinFactory will deliver a cohort of superbly-trained scientists, put the industrial and SME partners at the forefront of global competition and reinforce European innovation potentials with growth and job creation."
642954,"Software ENgineering in Enterprise Cloud Applications  systems","2015","2018","The growth of cloud computing is phenomenal, with vendors experiencing yearly growth over 90%. This reflects the rate at which organizations and individuals are leaving the comfort of tried and tested solutions to move into promising but uncharted territory.
The aim of SENECA is no less than to address key issues in the software engineering of cloud-based systems, including a disciplined approach to their development and operation. The project partners have pooled their considerable knowledge and experience to identify areas where applied research, industrial tests, as well as graduate-level training can deliver the most promising results.
The main challenge associated with cloud-based systems is their quality, as characterized (following ISO 25010) by their functional suitability, security, reliability, usability, performance efficiency, maintainability, and portability. Important quality issues include: How can the quality of a software-defined cloud infrastructure be measured and assured?  How can the security of a cloud-based system be ensured, taking into account that it may be running on an un-trusted infrastructure? How can the energy-efficiency and CO2 footprints of cloud-based applications be optimized?
SENECA addresses this challenge along the axes of A) cloud-based products and B) the cloud development process and tools. Research along axis A reaches from extending “traditional” quality assurance techniques to the cloud environment, to techniques for optimizing energy consumption by cloud systems without compromising performance or reliability. Research along axis B reaches from combining theory and practice to allow construction of secure systems on top of insecure cloud infrastructures, to improving testing practices for cloud development.
Additionally SENECA pursues objectives to train recruited fellows on conducting industry-motivated research and to create joint supervision structures among industry and academia in the software engineering community."

The oil-gas industry is meeting this threat with developing diverse technologies that work by different mechanisms but share a common goal: to reduce risks for the surrounding environment and to increase the recovery factor of reservoirs. 

The aim of this project would be to develop a new fully coupled framework as an extension of research INTERSECT simulator in which we can model dynamic crack propagation with the injection of high velocity fluid flow as observed in the hydraulic fracturing (“fracking”) of unconventional reservoirs."
642996,"Integrated view on disruptions of early brain development","2015","2018","Early onset neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are rather common, and affect more than 30 million children in Europe. The disorders carry a huge burden to the patients and their families and to society in general. This burden is linked to their chronic course and the absence of curative treatments. These neurodevelopmental disorders are thought to result from the disruption of normal brain development and related neurobiological mechanisms during the prenatal and early postnatal period. Recent advances in technology, infrastructure and analytic tools allow us now to identify these disruptions in brain development in the prenatal and early postnatal period, examine how this compromises the development of key social, attentional, motor and cognitive skills, and help understanding of the mechanisms that lead to neurodevelopmental disorders. This will facilitate developing new approaches to early detection, diagnosis and treatment. BRAINVIEW ETN provides a multidisciplinary and intersectoral (academia, companies, patient organizations) network environment in which cutting-edge science is combined with training young researchers in such an approach."
643045,"Applied mathematics for risk measures in finance and insurance, in the wake of the crisis","2015","2018","The EID WAKEUPCALL has been set up with the knowledge that, in the WAKE of the financial crisis, a reconsideration of fundamental assumptions that have been standard in the mathematical models for the valuation of financial and insurance products, like CALLs is taking place. The crisis alerted to reiterate models, assumptions and computations. It is now better understood that the usual paradigm, in which financial risks can be mitigated, spread, or even hedged away perfectly, is too simplistic for markets under stressed conditions. Lead by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, financial and insurance institutions are currently implementing new paradigms regarding risk management. Many of the updates in the risk measures involve sophisticated mathematics. In this sense, the crisis has provided important feedback on appropriate directions for the required mathematical improvements. As regards to hedging and risk mitigation, which are important steps in the risk management chain, nowadays even the hedging of basic financial instruments has become a complicated task. More sophisticated models are needed if hedging programs are to remain effective under financial stress.
We wish to bring together academic researchers in financial mathematics and high level professionals in financial and insurance industries, discuss and interact by means of early-stage researchers  (ESRs). We are interested in the mathematical models, as well as in advanced solution techniques used for pricing and risk measurement. We wish to educate young experts in modern risk measures and management. Advanced courses by academic and professional lecturers will be selected for the education of the ESRs. We will additionally work on providing entrepeneurial skills to ESRs as they will have a unique knowledge of applied mathematics on practically relevant research questions in computational finance. All ESRs will produce software, according to latest standards in high performance computing."

Despite their societal importance, progress in understanding disease biology has been slow and no curative treatment options are available.
The pan-European training network MiND aims to educate a new generation of researchers in the field of neurodevelopmental disorders, through innovation-oriented research combined with highly interdisciplinary and intersectoral international training.
Research and training in MiND span state-of-the-art topics in the fields of ADHD, ASD and their yet un-investigated overlap. We combine advanced (epi-)genetics approaches with bioinformatics and develop novel cell and animal models of increasing complexity to understand pathomechanisms. Integrated with research in large human DNA-neuroimaging-cognition data sets, we push forward the understanding of the biology leading from gene to cognition and disease. Our mechanistic work is embedded in a framework exploring alternative disease definitions for ADHD and ASD across the lifespan and working towards improved treatment: we use novel cognitive assessments, we probe the microbiome for dietary interventions reducing symptoms and evaluate mindfulness training as non-pharmacological treatment options, in addition to developing new compounds for pharmacological treatment optimization and individualization. The strategic collaboration of world-leading academic groups, research-intensive commercial enterprises and patient organisations will deliver 15 young, scientifically excellent researchers which are optimally prepared for private sector and academic careers.
MiND can be expected to impact patients and society by improving our understanding of disease biology, by developing novel diagnostic and treatment strategies, and by raising awareness for the necessity of research of neurodevelopmental disorders from childhood to adulthood."

This was initiated by launching an open call for Expressions of Interest (EoI) prior to this application and to which interested parties could respond. In total, 115 EoIs were received  and ranked by the TBVI Steering Committee using proposed H2020 evaluation criteria. This led to the prioritisation of 52 R&D approaches included in this proposal. 
TBVAC2020 aims to innovate and diversify the current TB vaccine and biomarker pipeline while at the same time applying portfolio management using gating and priority setting criteria to select as early as possible the most promising TB vaccine candidates, and accelerate their development. TBVAC2020 proposes to achieve this by combining creative “bottom-up” approaches for vaccine discovery (WP1), new preclinical models addressing clinical challenges (WP2) and identification and characterisation of correlates of protection (WP5) with a directive “top-down” portfolio management approach aiming to select the most promising TB vaccine candidates by their comparative evaluation using objective gating and priority setting criteria (WP6) and by supporting direct, head-to head or comparative preclinical and early clinical evaluation (WP3, WP4). This approach will both innovate and diversify the existing TB vaccine and biomarker pipeline as well as accelerate development of most promising TB vaccine candidates through early development stages. The proposed approach and involvement of many internationally leading groups in the TB vaccine and biomarker area in TBVAC2020 fully aligns with the Global TB Vaccine Partnerships (GTBVP)."

The system will give them access to a set of personalized health services in a near real-time fashion. This disruptive system will incorporate behavior change methods, such as “Do Something Different”, in conjunction with new innovative wearable/portable tools that can scan nature and volume of food and fluid intake, monitor behavior and clinical parameters in normal living situations. 
The objectives will be achieved by empowering patients with (1) tools and services, made available on smartphone or tablet and (2) the full control over the personal data they share with carers. To that extend a cyclic co-design methodology with end-users and health care professionals will be followed during the entire project. 
At the same time innovative end-user tools, including (1) a smart spatula for salt measurement, (2) a new artifact for fluid measurement and (3) a wearable food scan micro-spectrometer device, will be tested, (re-)designed and evaluated with patients and health professionals in Spain, NL and Taiwan. In view of the better balanced patient-care relationship, the traditional e-health telemonitoring will be enhanced with end-to-end trust assured transactions, secure storage, and ethical analytics of personal health data, making the patient an genuine stakeholder in his own cure processes and the ethical integration point of his own data. 
The proposal will be highly relevant to PCH 26 (ii): citizens’ life-style, socio-cultural values are continuously taken into account and a new range of mHealth tools is developed including a disruptive one from Taiwan. By providing concrete behavioral alternatives the new system will help patients to adhere to medical recommendations. Patient engagement and  sanitized data logistics are to lead to significant health cost reductions."

Time critical applications such as disaster early warning, collaborative communication and live event broadcasting can only realise their expected business value when they meet critical requirements for performance and user experience. The very high requirements on network and computing services, particularly for well-tuned software architecture with sophisticated data communication optimisation, mean that development of such time critical applications is often customised to dedicated infrastructure, and system performance is difficult to maintain when infrastructure changes. This fatal weakness in the existing architecture and software tools yields very high development cost, and makes it difficult fully to utilize the virtualised, programmable services provided by networked Clouds to improve system productivity. SWITCH aims at improving the existing development and execution model of time critical applications by introducing a novel conceptual model (application-infrastructure co-programming and control model), in which application QoS/QoE, together with the programmability and controllability of the Cloud environments, can all be included in the complete lifecycle of applications. Based on this conceptual model, SWITCH provides an interactive environment for developing applications and controlling their execution, a real-time infrastructure planner for deploying applications in Clouds, and an autonomous system adaptation platform for monitoring and adapting system behaviour. The SWITCH consortium has well-balanced partners with complementary expertise from both academic and industrial backgrounds. By demonstrating the software using diverse use cases, the consortium specifically aims at exploitation of the business potential of the SWITCH results."

The availability of a skilled workforce that accepts repetitive tasks in harsh greenhouse climate conditions is decreasing rapidly. The resulting increase in labour costs and reduced capacity puts major pressure on the competitiveness of the European greenhouse sector. Present robotization of  this labour has entered an high level of technological readiness. However, a gap remains which halts the transition from science to economic and societal impact; the so called ‘Technological Innovation Gap’. In the EU-FP7-project CROPS extensive research has been performed on agricultural robotics. One of the applications was a sweet pepper harvesting robot. It was shown that such a robot is economically and technically viable. The proven hardware and software modules (TRL:6) developed in CROPS will be used as the groundwork. The successful CROPS software modules based on the Robotic-Operating-System (ROS) will be maintained and expanded in SWEEPER. Also the gripper end-effector will be retained. This patent pending module is able to grasp the sweet pepper without the need of an accurate measurement of the position and orientation of the fruit. From the CROPS project, also gained knowledge will directly be put to benefit. In several experiments, it turned out that different growers use different cropping systems ranging in crop density. In SWEEPER, the cropping system itself will be optimized to facilitate robotic harvesting. In CROPS it was concluded that instead of a 9DOF, a 4DOF robot arm is sufficient , greatly reducing costs. To improve the level of robotic cognitive abilities, plant models will be applied to approximate  location of sweet peppers. This “model-based vision” will increase and speed up fruit detection. Based on the insights of CROPS, sensors will be placed onto the gripper only. Also a LightField sensor will be introduced which is able to record both colour and 3D information simultaneously."

Today, physicians are severely hampered by the lack of precision in positioning the needle tip. Real-time tissue-characterization feedback at the needle tip during these procedures can significantly improve the outcome of diagnosis and treatment, and reduce the cost of oncology treatment. Spectral tissue sensing using photonic needles has the promise to be a valuable diagnostic tool for screening tumours, as shown by several clinical trials. However, for widespread adoption the cost and size of these photonic needle systems - in particular the spectrometer console - needs to be improved dramatically. The realization of a low-cost miniature system is limited by three key challenges:
• Broadband (VIS\NIR) illumination
• Broadband (VIS\NIR) sensitivity
• Integration of the system
InSPECT will address these challenges by developing and integrating photonic building blocks for low-cost miniaturized spectral tissue sensing devices. This involves the realization of a miniature broadband (400-1700 nm) solid-state light source, based on phosphor and quantum-dot converted LEDs, and the realization of a miniature low-cost integrated VIS\NIR spectrometer. For the spectrometer integration we will follow 2 approaches: 
• The micro-spectrometer, a moderate risk approach based on the miniaturisation and monolithic integration of diffractive dispersive elements and VIS\NIR photo-detectors in a small volume (cubic inch) device, and 
• The nano-spectrometer, a higher risk approach in which the spectrometer function is realized in a photonic integrated circuit (PIC) based on transparent SiO/SiN waveguide technology. 
This is a unique, novel, and timely approach to realize the key photonics building blocks for low-cost miniature spectrometers that will drive the adoption of spectral sensing in applications that were not accessible before."

645622,"Post-quantum cryptography for long-term security","2015","2018","Online banking, e-commerce, telemedicine, mobile communication, and cloud computing depend fundamentally on the security of the underlying cryptographic algorithms. Public-key algorithms are particularly crucial since they provide digital signatures and establish secure communication without requiring in-person meetings.

Essentially all applications today are based on RSA or on the discrete-logarithm problem in finite fields or on elliptic curves. Cryptographers optimize parameter choices and implementation details for these systems and build protocols on top of these systems; cryptanalysts fine-tune attacks and establish exact security levels for these systems. Alternative systems are far less visible in research and unheard of in practice.

It might seem that having three systems offers enough variation, but these systems are all broken as soon as large quantum computers are built. The EU and governments around the world are investing heavily in building quantum computers; society needs to be prepared for the consequences, including cryptanalytic attacks accelerated by these computers. Long-term confidential documents such as patient health-care records and state secrets have to guarantee security for many years, but information encrypted today using RSA or elliptic curves and stored until quantum computers are available will then be as easy to decipher as Enigma-encrypted messages are today.

PQCRYPTO will allow users to switch to post-quantum cryptography: cryptographic systems that are not merely secure for today but that will also remain secure long-term against attacks by quantum computers. PQCRYPTO will design a portfolio of high-security post-quantum public-key systems, and will improve the speed of these systems, adapting to the different performance challenges of mobile devices, the cloud, and the Internet of Things. PQCRYPTO will provide efficient implementations of high-security post-quantum cryptography for a broad spectrum of real-world applications."

In the academic community, Business Model Innovation (BMI) has for a long time been recognized as the key to improved competitiveness and innovativeness. However, BMI does not reach SMEs yet nor is there knowledge on how SMEs conduct BMI in practice.
Empowering SMEs to conduct BMI requires new approaches. By leveraging existing networks and communities, we will gather examples, best practices and insights into Business Models (BM) from case studies from each and every European region or industry, complemented with insights from other leading countries worldwide. The BM vortex will thus generate an enormous and rich library of business models patterns and managerial structures, provided on a platform,  to support SMEs in these communities. We will also develop innovative tooling and provide them on the platform to makes it easy for SMEs to develop, evaluate and plan new business models. 
The ENVISION consortium covers Northern, Western, Central, Eastern and Southern Europe. In each region a top-ranked academic institution in the field of BMI is present as well as innovative businesses that deliver smart and tailored BMI tooling and reach out to SMEs. We build on over a decade of joint work on BMI and BM tooling. We will build and maintain regional and thematic communities. In the communities, support is delivered to help SMEs transform and improve their BMs. 
The consortium also includes partners and associated partners that will realize our pan-European reach to SMEs: on a pan-European level (e.g., UAEPME and female entrepreneurs’ network), on a national and regional level (e.g., chambers of commerce, family business organizations and statistical offices). The consortium also has linkages to EIT/ICT Labs and the European Service Innovation Centre (ESIC)."

The Innovation Union has the main objective to strengthen the European innovative potential, and sets 13 general objectives and 34 specific (policy) commitments associated to the objectives, and aimed at stimulating innovation. 
The objective of this project is to deliver a system of assessment for the commitments. The approach starts from the evaluation of the state of achievement of the individual commitments, but puts crucial emphasis on their effects in the innovation system as a whole, as well as on the economy-wide effects of innovation. The basic idea is to retrace the entire chain of effects of the commitments, from their implementation to their final impact in terms of competitiveness, growth or employment. 
The specific tasks that project sets out to undertake to achieve this are:
1) Data collection and identification of mechanisms;
2) Developing theoretical and econometric models in order to estimate the impact of the commitments;
3) Developing a conceptual model of the innovation system, leading to a reference tool on which the impact analysis of the commitments individually and as a whole will be based, and which will also play a role of interface between the assessments of the commitments impact and the macro sectoral econometric work.
4) A quantitative analysis of the commitments by use of the NEMESIS model, which is an existing macro-structural econometric model, but which will be modified and extended for the tasks at hand;
5) An ex-ante and ex-post policy assessment of the economic effects of the Innovation Union at European, national and regional levels;

MACIVIVA will pave the path to other large scale thermostable nanopharmaceuticals products for therapeutic and prophylactic vaccines and other potential applications for direct application by non-invasive routes.
Liquid products are inherently prone to physical and/or chemical modifications and degradations. Solid vaccine dosage formats (e.g. powder) may prevent molecular motion and shear-induced degradation, and slow down degradation involving water and oxygen radicals, resulting in improved stability and enhanced shelf-life of vaccines. The cold chain storage is still fundamental for preserving the bioactivity of most liquid and freeze-dried vaccines, and a reconstitution step prior to administration is required for freeze dried vaccines that are usually administered intramuscularly or subcutaneously. These reconstituted freeze dried vaccines harbor important instability and must be used within hours and kept refrigerated. Because most liquid and reconstituted freeze-dried vaccines are susceptible to degradations, it may affect the immunological properties of the immunogens, with unwanted immune responses or insufficient immune protection. 
For addressing liquid virosome-based vaccine instability and improving their shelf-life outside the cold chain, MACIVIVA will explore new galenic vaccine formulations through careful screening of excipients, stabilization and drying methods for generating new vaccine solid forms that can be easily self-administered. Robust “universal” manufacturing processes for upscale production of virosome dried powder for the non-invasive intranasal, oral and sublingual routes should be achieved by month 42."

In this proposal we argue that entrepreneurship must play a central role in that effort. 'Entrepreneurship' tends to make people think of the US and its model of high growth and high-tech start-ups in Silicon Valley. We are keenly aware, however, that a European growth agenda requires a focus on European entrepreneurship. US recipes and models will not fit the European context and do not deliver the results Europe wants. Our project's objective is therefore to thoroughly analyse European institutional arrangements and their current (in)ability to mobilise Europe’s human, financial and knowledge resources for entrepreneurial activity. This will help us formulate an effective reform strategy to reinvigorate European economies. The current diversity of institutional arrangements in Europe has long and common historical roots that must first be recognised and understood. Based on common global trends in technology and competition, we then establish the urgency and desirability for making the transition to a more entrepreneurial economy throughout Europe.  Once this has been established, our project will develop and provide the tools for policy makers to assess the quality of national and regional entrepreneurial ecosystems and to identify the main strengths and weaknesses with regard to making the transition. Based on this assessment we will formulate specific proposals to enhance the allocation of talent, finance and knowledge to new value creation and we will conclude our project with a legal analysis to see where competencies currently lie and what action could be taken."

In the R4E project a four step process is applied. The FIRST step sets the ambitions for the project. The ambitions of the participating cities on sustainable energy and Smart Cities in general are set, as well as the partner cities' choice for 2 focus areas within Smart Energy Savings: 1.Smart Buildings, 2. Smart Mobility or 3. Smart Urban Spaces. The SECOND step is to develop desired scenarios for the cities for the selected focus areas. During the THIRD step the roadmap will be created, existing and future technologies and other developments will be identified, which enable the realization of the desired future scenarios. Opportunities and developments will be plotted on a timeline to provide insight in the required steps and milestones towards the favoured scenarios. The roadmaps will contain generic parts that are common for the partner cities, as well as specific parts that cater for the specific context of the cities. During the final and FOURTH step a project portfolio will be generated with new projects and initiatives to reach the ambitions, visions and roadmaps of the cities. This portfolio provides an overview of individual and joint projects and includes a cross-city learning plan and a financial plan.   
At the end of the project each partner city will each have 2 future scenarios, 2 roadmaps and a portfolio of individual and joint projects to implement sustainable energy policies and measures. Also the visioning and roadmapping capacities within the municipalities are developed to spur future development and implementation of innovative energy solutions."

649867,"STEam And Management Under Pressure","2015","2018","The industrial sector could reduce its energy use by at least 13%. 75% of the potential savings can be found in steam and electric motor systems. Actions to tap the full potential in steam systems have been taken in the past but without success since findings from energy audits were not, or partly, implemented. 

The following barriers have been identified:
- There is no business case for steam saving measures for enterprise decision makers;
- There is a lack of technical (steam) expertise of energy auditors and within enterprises generally;
- There is no formal organisational structure for dealing with energy efficiency (energy management).
The objectives and goals of the STEAM-UP proposal are: 
• Bridging the gap between audit results and implementation by developing an in-depth steam audit covering:
- state of the art steam expertise;
- involvement of all stakeholders in the enterprise;
- identification of non-energy benefits to strengthen business cases;
- energy management to secure prolongation.
• Reducing the effort for measure implementation by developing an integrated solution for business case reporting  and energy management implementation.
• Achieve energy savings during this action of 55,6 GWh/a through piloting 75 of the in-depth steam audits. 
• Building capacity amongst 400 energy auditors for the use of the in-depth steam audit methodology in their daily practise.
• Building capacity amongst stakeholders in 75 enterprises on steam and the business benefits to increase steam efficiency.
• Building capacity amongst 40 energy management training providers to enable integration of the in-depth steam audit methodology in regular energy training programmes. 
• Promote knowledge transfer on steam and the benefits to increase steam efficiency. 
This project focuses on the large, energy-intensive industry but the methodology will also be applicable for SMEs. The developed methodology can be made applicable for a wide range of utilities and processes."

The current proposal will continue and expand the work of FP7 PLATFORM (2012-2014) with the following objectives: to further increase collaboration among actors, to foster inclusiveness, to increase capacities for efficient and effective ERA-NETs, and to inform research policy making. 

FP7 PLATFORM organised inspiring annual events, dedicated workshops, a master class for call managers, fruitful two-way interaction with the Commission, the EIP AGRI and with the BBI-JU, and produced a comprehensive book about the bioeconomy ERA-NETs and their activities. Surveys, analysis and events also engaged ERA-NETs from neighbouring themes with bioeconomy relevance, JPIs Oceans and FACCE, SCAR WGs, and self-sustained ERA-NETs. 

PLATFORM2 will build on these activities and will further strengthen mutual learning, maximise synergies and increase coordination. PLATFORM2 will expand the network to new ERA-NET actions (Cofund), to more JPIs and will also seek stronger interaction with SCAR. On the website, a searchable database on bioeconomy ERA-NET joint calls will be constructed, including statistics and impact assessments, such as on leverage. Data may flow into other data repositories, e.g. an EIP Agri database on projects in the area of agriculture. A World Café workshop is scheduled to ponder new, sustainable and alternative models for cooperation between public research programmes. PLATFORM2 will make an inventory of alignment actions taken by ERA-NETs. The series of Annual Events will be continued and enable actors to discuss emerging cooperation needs, opportunities and tools. PLATFORM2 will foster inclusiveness in all its work, in particular by a master class directed at new Member States and sessions at the Annual Events on improving both involvement and performance. Capacities will be increased by sharing experience and by way of master classes on planning and managing (Cofund) calls, as well as through evaluation and monitoring of ERA-NETs. The reflections and recommendations will be summarised in policy briefs."

The work will, in a single coordinated project, address all aspects of this topic and will be conducted by 26 partners representing the European automotive industry (OEMs (EUCAR), suppliers (CLEPA), ESPs and universities (EARPA)) including members of ERTRAC and EGVIA. The objective is to achieve efficient, compact, low weight, robust and cost effective hybrid powertrains for both passenger cars and commercial vehicles (buses, medium and heavy duty trucks) with increased functionality, improved performance, comfort, safety and emissions below Euro 6 or VI, all proven under real driving conditions. The five demonstrator vehicles, for this purpose developed to TRL 7,  that use the hybrid powertrains will among other give a direct cost versus performance comparison at two system voltage levels in the light duty vehicles, and include the modular and standardized framework components in the heavy duty vehicles. Achieving these innovations affordably will strengthen technical leadership in powertrains, enable a leading position in hybrid technology and increases the competitiveness of European OEMs. The vehicles will be ready for market introduction between 2020 and 2022 and (price) competitive to the best in-class (full hybrid) vehicles on the market in 2013. More importantly, the technology devised will impact on the reduction of CO2 emissions and the improvement of air quality. The project proposes to reach a 20% powertrain efficiency improvement and a 20% powertrain weight and volume reduction, with a ≤10% cost premium on the base model for the demonstrator. To meet air quality targets the project will prove, via independently supervised testing, real driving emissions at least below Euro 6 or VI limits and by simulation show the potential of the passenger car technologies to reach Super Low Emission Vehicle standards."

To advance scientific progress in understanding the complexity of natural systems it is required that supporting research infrastructures cooperate globally to serve the essential data at different temporal and spatial scales. This includes providing the capabilities to process big and massive datasets. GLOBIS-B is a global cooperation of world-class research infrastructures with a focus on targeted services to support frontier research that deals with predicting the biosphere and measuring the indicators of biodiversity change. The project brings key scientists together with global research infrastructure operators and legal interoperability experts to address research needs and infrastructure services underpinning the concept of Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs). EBVs were proposed by the GEO Biodiversity Observation Network (GEO BON) and are a prerequisite for understanding biodiversity and ecosystem change. Integrated scientific and technical workshops will identify the required primary data, analysis tools, methodologies etc. to develop an infrastructure development agenda for computing EBVs and to explore the discovery of required and interoperable data at larger spatial and temporal scales. Applications of common standards and workflows that are ‘self-documenting’ and openly shared facilitate international cooperation, and realistic and pragmatic solutions are explored to streamline the legal bottlenecks for the reciprocal use of data and software tools from different origins. Solutions should be workable for both the scientific communities and the cooperating research infrastructures, especially in regard to achieving direct machine-machine interactions. The interaction with national, supra-national and global policy bodies contributes to potential refinements of general policies supporting legal interoperability."

That has been done through a combination of large scale projects which were part publicly funded with European funding and partly through smaller privately funded research activities.

From the initial stages of feasibility studies, several technologies were put forward for further development, one of which is the HIsarna smelting reduction process

The objective for the current proposal is to prove the capability of the HIsarna ironmaking technology to achieve at least 35% reduction in CO2 emission intensity, compared to blast furnace operated site based on Best Available Technology Currently Installed. This will be achieved through:

-Change operation parameters in order to achieve at least 35% CO2 intensity reduction per tonne of hot rolled coil compared to the conventional blast furnace – BOF route through:
   >Combined iron ore and scrap operation with a scrap rate of 350kg/thm;
   >Partially replacing coal injection with sustainable biomass injection (at least 40%);
   >Minimising coal rate by maximising energy use in the reactor, through balancing the energy between the upper and lower part of the reactor (<700 kg coal per tonne hot metal in pilot reactor);
   >Using limestone instead of burnt lime as a fluxing agent;
   >Quantifying potential for energy recovery from hot off-gas by installing boiler test panels;
   >Making the process ‘CCS ready’ by having process gas suitable for CCS with little or no processing by replacing compressed air and N2 carrier gasses with CO2 and CH4 as carrier gas;
-Operation of the HIsarna pilot plant for several months continuously in order to establish process and equipment stability; 
-Test process conditions and validate for scale up to 0.8 Mtpa plant"

The Fellow will gain skills in a range of cutting-edge techniques for studying plant defences against herbivore attack whereas the Host group will benefit from the Fellows’ expertise in methods of behavioural assays not currently utilized in the group. The Fellow and the Host will address together the complexity of plant-insect interactions using a very innovative approach based on the hidden role played by Herbivore-Associated-Organisms (HAOs). In fact, insect herbivores often consist of a community themselves including bacteria, fungi, parasitic worms, parasitic wasps and viruses which may play an important role in the expression of the herbivore’s phenotype and consequently on interactions of the herbivore with its food plant. However, up to date, most of the studies investigating plant defences have considered insect herbivores as individual organisms, thus neglecting the role of HAOs. The Fellow and the Host propose to experimentally manipulate the HAO composition to evaluate the effects on induced plant defences from plant gene expression to wider community consequences. This project is expected to advance the state-of-the-art of plant-insect interactions putting Europe research in the forefront of the research topic. This fellowships is also ideal for reaching the researcher’s scientific and professional maturity, to build up long lasting collaborations and finally to establish his own group afterwards."
655424,"Cross-talk between inflammation and autophagy in tuberculosis","2016","2018","The increasing occurrence of multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains makes tuberculosis (TB) a key priority for infectious disease research. Inflammation and autophagy are two fundamental processes critical to TB pathogenesis. Accumulating evidence shows that TB disease is worsened by deregulation of the inflammatory response. On the other hand, autophagy has recently emerged as a crucial host defence mechanism. Autophagy counteracts the ability of mycobacteria to survive inside host cells and targets them for degradation. Autophagy is also thought to control the inflammatory response. However, the interaction between inflammation and autophagy in host defence against TB remains unclear. The aim of my proposal is to use the well-established zebrafish model of TB to gain insight into this key question. Recently, the host laboratory discovered that the DNA damage-regulated autophagy modulator (DRAM1) protects against TB in the zebrafish model. They also implicated this important autophagy regulator in inflammation, as it strongly affects expression of interleukin-1beta (IL1B). I have specific expertise in studying IL1B-mediated inflammation in zebrafish. Thus the proposed project will be a great synergy between me and the host laboratory, which is leading in zebrafish infectious disease research. I will determine how modulation of autophagy or manipulation of IL1B levels reciprocally influence each other during TB disease. The zebrafish model provides excellent tools to visualize these processes in vivo. Furthermore, I will take advantage of the host’s expertise in RNA sequencing and proteomics to study genome-wide effects of autophagy modulation on the inflammatory response. A secondment will allow me to compare results in the TB model with a damage-induced inflammation model. The project will provide new insights into regulatory pathways that could potentially be intervened in treatment of TB or other inflammatory diseases with common characteristics."
655761,"Do extreme climatic events facilitate plant invasions?","2016","2018","Extreme climate events (ECEs) are projected to increase in magnitude and frequency as global warming intensifies the global water cycle. Global warming is also changing species distribution patterns by affecting native plant communities and by enabling alien species to expand beyond their native range. We increasingly realize that climate change and biological invasions act together, leading to even more dramatic outcomes. However, how ECEs will affect the incidence and strength of biological invasions remains poorly understood. Therefore, the overall objective of EXTREME is to develop a mechanistic understanding of how increased climatic variability and ECEs affect alien plant invasions. I will relate the incidence of species invasiveness with climate variability and the occurrence of ECEs, using drylands as study system. A novel approach to develop further understanding is the inclusion of genomic features in explaining the response to ECEs. A modelling approach will be combined with a common-garden experiment to study the effect of drought and heavy rainfall on the performance of native and alien plant species in a model dryland system in South Africa. EXTREME will allow me to diversify my individual competence by acquiring new skills (statistical and climate modelling and GIS) and competencies (academic leadership, proposal writing, project management). EXTREME will strongly benefit my inter-sectoral and interdisciplinary expertise and strengthen my international network, which is also beneficial for the host. A two-way transfer of knowledge is guaranteed since EXTREME combines my expertise in invasion and evolutionary ecology with the host’s expertise in the effect of climate variability and extremes. Therefore, EXTREME is not only expected to catalyse my career development, but will contribute to Europe’s knowledge-based economy and society by providing invaluable knowledge on climate change and invasive species that is of the highest priority in the EU."
656129,"Superconducting magnetic-field compatible quantum electronics","2015","2018","In superconducting quantum electronics, or superquantronics, macroscopic degrees of freedom, like currents and voltages, can exist in a quantum mechanical superposition. This macroscopic quantum coherence has led to the development of circuits behaving as atoms. An exciting new field of research is circuit-based quantum electrodynamics (cQED), in which these artificial atoms are placed in cavities to perform quantum optics in the microwave regime. This cQED architecture is arguably the most promising platform for realizing a full-scale quantum computer. However, a major draw-back of the circuits used for cQED today, which contain aluminum films, is that superconductivity is lost upon applying strong magnetic fields. This limitation poses a fundamental obstacle to interfacing superquantronic circuits with other quantum systems that rely on these strong magnetic fields for their operation. By forming such hybrid systems, new technologies can be developed, such as long term quantum memories for superconducting qubits using highly coherent solid-state spin ensembles, or a topological quantum computer using Majorana Fermions.
The goal of this proposal is to realize magnetic-field compatible superquantronic circuits for the cQED architecture.
A promising new approach is to combine magnetic-field compatible superconducting materials with semiconducting nanowires to build new circuit elements. We plan to develop circuits using these new elements and demonstrate the coherent operation of an artificial atom in cQED in the presence of a strong magnetic field. 
The magnetic-field compatible superquantronic circuits we will develop, provide a unique platform to create and study new quantum devices. This fellowship, along with his previous research experience with a wide range of quantum systems, will allow the applicant to define new research directions in fundamental physics and experimental quantum information science, by developing new hybrid quantum systems."

Numerous Mental-Health problems in youth are significantly related with poor capacity of Emotion Regulation (ER). Adaptive ER strategies influence the intensity, duration, and expression of emotions, modifying emotional reactions in a socially tolerable and sufficiently flexible way. Thus, learning adaptive ER strategies has strong potential in promoting physical and psychological well-being in youth. However, the promise of an easy access and implementation of ER programs remains disappointedly unrealised for the following reasons. (1) Learning of ER competencies is almost invisible in European school curricula. (2) There is a lack of studies in youth that compare ER strategies to provide sufficient evidence-based criteria and guidelines. (3) The needs of the digital natives’ generation have not been taken into consideration in ER programs, often lacking the engaging and motivational aspects and a high quality assessment. (4) There is an issue of adaptability of ER interventions to the school context. Thus, the main objective of PEACEFUL MIND is to develop an attractive program, using Information and Communication Technologies, as well as ecological and objective measures, to teach youths adaptive ER strategies. By doing so, we will directly influence social, emotional, and cognitive development of youths that will have an impact during their entire lives. Finally, the multidisciplinary training objective will provide an extensive clinical training in third wave therapies, training in research methodology, gaining experience in teaching, tutoring, and additional research competencies, which will open up the opportunity to become an expert in both the academic and private sectors, and will greatly contribute to my objective of becoming a scientific leader in third wave therapies and e-health."

Even though weak states have received considerable attention from scholars and policy-makers, the concept of state weakness has remained under-theorized.

Previous work mostly assumed that the reason why states do not exercise coercion and care throughout the territory is simply their inability to do so. This perspective, however, cannot explain why states invest more in building capacity in some regions than in others, or why coercive and caring capacity are geographically uneven. To understand this, it is crucial to acknowledge that states in the developing world can and do invest in building capacity, but are also confronted with the need to ration resources.

656385,"Electrogenic NItrate Reduction In marine Sediments","2016","2018","Recently, a novel type of long, filamentous bacteria has been discovered, which are capable of guiding electrical currents over centimeter distances. These so-called “cable bacteria” were first isolated from marine sediments, and laboratory experiments demonstrate that electrons are passed on from cell to cell along the longitudinal axis of the filaments. This long-distance electron transport radically extends the physiological capacities of prokaryotes, and profoundly changes our understanding of biogeochemical transformations in marine sediments. 
In my PhD research, I have documented that in addition to oxygen, these sulphur oxidizing bacteria can also use nitrate as an electron acceptor. This new form of “electrogenic” nitrate reduction could have important implications for the removal of bio-available N in marine ecosystems. However, the effect of this newly described nitrate reducing process on the global nitrogen cycle, as well as the factors that ultimately control the occurrence, remain unknown.
The goal of this project is to identify the end products of the electrogenic nitrate reduction and the environmental controls that regulate its occurrence. This project will hence provide new insights into the physiological abilities of micro-organisms and improve our understanding of N dynamics in marine sediments, strengthening European excellence in these fields of research.
The goals of the project will be attained by combining state-of-the-art biogeochemical techniques with a novel and interdisciplinary approach based on principles traditionally applied in microbiology, electrochemistry and geophysics.
This project will allow me to work on an up-to-front topic and thus to build up a unique research profile among the large number of researchers in the of nitrogen cycling."
656601,"Behavior and molecular signature of Neural Stem Cells, and changes occurring during aging","2016","2018","In the adult neurogenic niches, neural stem cells (NSCs) generate neurons throughout life. During aging, the number of newborn neurons is clearly reduced, although it is still very debated what specifically happens to the NSCs: do they die, increase their quiescence or change their fate? It is emerging that NSCs are heterogeneous, with different subtypes, in particular quiescent and active NSCs, responding differently to neurogenic stimuli, including aging. However, due to difficulties in distinguishing NSCs subtypes in vivo, their behavior in the physiological environment, their molecular hallmarks, and especially how those are changed during aging are still elusive. These are key questions in neuroscience and stem cell biology. Thanks to the combination of the host laboratory expertise with mine, the current action proposes to develop a strategy to discriminate different NSCs in vivo and shed new light on their behavior, molecular properties and the changes occurring during life. The expected results are going to provide critical information on the regenerative potential of NSCs subtypes and on whether and how the aging phenotype can be reverted, with a consequent strong scientific and social impact."
656632,"Plant Ecology for Nitrous Oxide Mitigation and Sustainable Productivity","2016","2018","Agricultural soils are the dominant source of nitrous oxide (N2O), a potent greenhouse gas as well as a major cause of ozone layer depletion. Recent findings show that combinations of plants with complementary root traits can increase nitrogen (N) uptake leading to lower N2O emissions. Based on the microbiology behind soil N2O emissions and on plant-trait based ecology, this project aims to build on this finding and develop a novel N2O mitigation strategy. We aim to reveal how plants and plant interactions via their traits and trait combinations can be used to reduce N2O emissions in a context of climate change related disturbances (drought and intense rainfall). Starting with microcosm incubations using monocultures of different plant species, we will quantify the relative importance of specific plant traits as means to regulate N2O emissions. An ensemble of inter- and multi-disciplinary techniques will be applied to analyse the ecological and agronomical plant characteristics of potential relevance as well as the plant-specific microbiological communities of importance for the N-cycle. Subsequently, greenhouse mesocosm experiments will be used to expand the acquired knowledge to cover interactions between plants and stresses induced by climate change factors. A meta-analysis of published and unpublished datasets will allow further elucidation of specific and interactive mechanisms, differentiated by environmental and management factors and to include studies over longer time frames. Finally, the generated results will be used to calibrate and validate a process-based model in order to extrapolate our findings to regional levels. Deliverables will be peer-reviewed papers, new experimental data on a new N2O mitigation strategy, improved model tools to simulate mitigation and reports to policy makers and stake holders on a N2O mitigation strategy that concurrently maintains / increases agricultural production. Overall, ECONOMY will guide future N2O mitigation policy."
656954,"A new approach to revealing the composition of kimberlite melts and their deep mantle source","2016","2018","The overarching aim of this project is to provide novel constraints on the composition of the Earth’s deep mantle, particularly its volatile content, by undertaking an innovative geochemical and isotopic study of the deepest formed melts on Earth: kimberlites. Kimberlite melts are derived from depths in excess of 150-200 km. They are important as the major host of diamonds and because entrain xenoliths (i.e. fragments) of upper mantle and deep crustal rocks during ascent to the surface, providing a major source of information about the geochemistry of the deep Earth. Despite their importance, the composition of primary kimberlite melts and their exact mantle source are hotly debated issues. This is due to contamination of kimberlite melts by mantle and crustal rocks during magma emplacement and near surface alteration of primary kimberlite mineralogy.
To determine the composition of primary kimberlite melts, I will employ a novel approach that combines radiogenic (Sr-Nd-Pb) and stable (C-O) isotope fingerprinting of melt inclusions in kimberlitic magmatic minerals (i.e. olivine and spinel), using innovative ultra-sensitive techniques. This approach will constrain if the carbonate-dominated melt inclusions truly represent examples of pristine kimberlite magma by quantifying processes like crustal contamination and degassing that may have altered the melt composition. I will investigate kimberlites from targeted localities from different parts of the world (South Africa, Canada, Greenland, Russia) and of variable age (Proterozoic to Cretaceous) to assess if there are spatial and/or temporal controls to kimberlite composition. The melt inclusions C-O isotope data, coupled with O isotope analyses of kimberlitic olivine, spinel and perovskite, are designed to test if recycled crustal material occurs in the deep mantle source of kimberlites, which would provide important new constraints on the global cycle of volatiles through geological time."

Even though massive aid budgets from the major donors, including the European Union, are allocated to expand Morocco’s programmes to combat poverty, social exclusion and gender inequality, rural women are still poorly integrated in Moroccan society. Using an original interdisciplinary approach of ethnobiology, development studies and geography, this study will explore whether women are able to gain social status and economic development through applying their traditional ecological knowledge in the context of the Green Morocco Plan in two rural communes of Rhamna Province. The study will cover the two main issues: 1) an analysis of the socio-historical, political context of the country, to assess the interests and motives of the Moroccan government to address gender issues; 2), an ethnographic investigation into women’s traditional knowledge activities looking in particular at the transfer of women’s traditional knowledge and environmental practices to new income generating activities. The policy relevance of the study lies in its aim to ensure that a gender aware ‘rural traditional dimension’ is included in programme policies with concrete proposals on how to overcome rural women’s socio-economic stagnation, and improve the working conditions of rural women in Morocco. It will contribute to the current debate of gender analysis, environmental practices and women’s integration in development programmes. The Fellowship is expected to deliver a curriculum to expand this new field of enquiry to resolve issues of social exclusion.  It will open up perspectives of employment for the researcher in a European academic institution or a policy research institute."
658425,"Social Jet Lag: Avian Solutions to Misalignment between Circadian Clocks and Social Cues","2016","2018","Organisms and their cells exhibit alternating phases of activity and inactivity that are regulated by internal ~24h (circadian) clocks. These clocks synchronize to natural fluctuations in day-light, but also likely respond to other factors including the activity of the social group.

Here, we propose to investigate how individuals cope with misalignment between their circadian clock and social time (“social jet lag”) – a phenomenon studied in only few species (mainly humans and other mammals) and rarely tested in groups of more than two individuals. Specifically, we will investigate how groups achieve collective synchrony when their members have circadian clocks with different periods or entrained to different environmental cues. Multidisciplinary investigations (physiological, behavioural, and ecological) will be conducted on groups of Red Knots (Calidris canutus islandica) - the hosts’ well established avian model. The project will combine the applicant’s expertise in collecting and analysing extensive circadian datasets, the hosts’ experimental set up in the world’s only tidal aviaries, and the partner’s expertise on an array of circadian clock measurement tools, including a novel molecular method never experimentally applied in birds before.

This unique investigation of social jet lag in a non-human social animal will have three main implications. First, it will test the applicability of a new method to quantify circadian clocks for avian research in general. Second, it will reveal how individuals cope with social jet lag and synchronize to the timing of their group – an important topic in the field of ‘time research’ which, according to the recent “foresight” study, is one of six fields of key importance for scientific and technological development. Third, it will help us understand whether and how individuals, in a particular social setting, cope with fast environmental changes of the kind increasingly generated by human modification of habitat."
658614,"Models of Structure in Music","2016","2018","Music is an art form with a very long history, and continues to engage millions of people today. Music Information Retrieval (MIR), the exciting interdisciplinary science that brings together music and computer science, is a growing field of research with the potential to enrich computer science knowledge while creating real-world applications that everyone can benefit from. While the marriage of art and science is often troublesome, MIR has the benefit that many aspects of music are highly structural and have been subject to formalisation for a long time. Formalisation and computers go hand in hand, and MIR researchers have therefore been developing models of musical structure for many years, and putting them to use in several applications. However, such models, so far, have had limited impact; they're commonly restricted to one specific aspect of music, can be hard to implement computationally, and are often too technical to be used directly by musicologists who are not familiar with programming details.

However, models are valuable. Unlike machine learning approaches, model-based MIR provides a real insight about the underlying structure, and can benefit from the input of musicologist experts. Furthermore, a single model can be applied to multiple important MIR tasks. The research goal of this project is thus to give musical models the impact they deserve, advancing the practical embodiment of hierarchical musical structure-in its various forms-in computer science through the development of new, functional Models of Structure in Music (MoStMusic). Specifically, I intend to develop functional models of musical form, melody, and harmony that enable an easy, fast, and flexible way of creating model-enhanced MIR applications. As a showcase of such an application, I will create an online music analyser that automatically computes the structure present in a user-submitted piece, and displays it in an interactive interface that highlights the structural shape of music."

Its renewable attribute makes solar sailing a truly mission enabling technology, which is exploited by S4ILS to further one of Europe’s key space priorities, Space Situational Awareness (SSA): the new orbits will improve our ability to keep ground and space assets safe from natural cosmic hazards (e.g. space weather) and man-made threats from space (debris). 
S4ILS offers novelty of research and solutions to global challenges, as well as excellent training of the Experienced Researcher (ER) by a world-leading astrodynamics institute at the University of Colorado, USA, and by one of Europe’s top universities of technology, TU Delft, the Netherlands. The entire team of renowned experts in astrodynamics, low-thrust space mission design and SSA built around the ER enables a unique fusion of knowledge and a pool of resources, creating the best environment for the ER to fully develop her potential. 
The fundamentally new orbital dynamics that S4ILS will deliver combined with the compelling application of SSA, that impacts industries far beyond the aerospace sector, will put solar sailing firmly on the European space agenda and will underpin the need for further European solar sail technology development. Influencing decision makers is ensured by collaborating with the American space agency (NASA) and through a secondment at the European Space Agency. These opportunities expose the ER to a vast international network, crucial for starting an independent research career.

This risk of relapse highlights a need for treatments that persist. Research on reconsolidation has shown that upon reactivation old fear memories can be updated, preventing the return of fear. However, studies targeting reconsolidation to reduce fear have reported mixed results because its boundary conditions are poorly understood. To live up to its clinical potential it is necessary to understand how to most effectively utilize paradigms targeting reconsolidation. The proposed research attempts to address this issue by providing a neural measure of the reconsolidation process itself. This will be achieved by determining whether dynamic patterns of neural network activity that occur during initial learning re-occur during offline ‘rest’ periods, and test whether this ‘replay’ of memory is linked to reconsolidation. The first objective of this grant application is to identify and quantify a neural marker of reconsolidation that predicts the absence of fear recovery.  During the outgoing phase these questions will be addressed employing an innovative cross-species (humans, rats) approach using similar behavioural tasks, complementary recording techniques (functional magnetic resonance imaging, multi-unit recordings) and state-of-the-art analyses methods. Acquired knowledge and experience will be applied during the return phase where the second objective is to use this neural marker to determine how context serves as one critical boundary condition to inducing reconsolidation. Findings will significantly advance fundamental understanding of reconsolidation and have important implication for applied and preclinical psychiatric research."
659545,"H2 and CH4 Dissociation Dynamics on Stepped Metal Surfaces via First-Principles Simulations","2016","2018","With STEPDYN I propose to achieve for the first time an accurate theoretical and computational modelling of the reactive scattering of small molecules on stepped metal surfaces. The aim is to close the ‘material gap’ in our fundamental understanding of heterogeneous catalytic processes at the gas/solid interface, since stepped surfaces are close models of the active sites of catalyst particles. Specifically, I will focus on two processes:
(i)	dissociation of H2 on the stepped surface (211) of copper: H2/Cu(211)
(ii)	dissociation of CH4 on the stepped surface (211) of nickel: CH4/Ni(211)
Both are activated dissociation processes of great importance for heterogeneous catalysis in the energy field (they are linked to methanol, methane and H2 processing). Using appropriate specific-reaction-parameter (SRP) density-functional theory for the systems of interest I will: (i) construct 6-dimensional potential energy surfaces and use them in quantum dynamics of H2/Cu(211), (ii) employ ab-initio Molecular Dynamics with a semi-classical description of nuclear motion for CH4/Ni(211). Possible methodological issues associated with structural degrees of freedom and anisotropy, localized electronic states, etc. will be systematically explored.
This will be achieved in a MC fellowship during which I will:
(i)	work in an internationally recognized and scientifically stimulating group, leader in modeling molecular reactive scattering on metallic surfaces
(ii)	further and deepen my knowledge in scattering approaches to heterogeneous catalysis, grounding on what I matured in a 9-months visit during my PhD. 
(iii)	combine it with my post-doc expertise in theoretical catalysis , 
(iv)	face a challenging but important project requiring new methods, thus maturing my researcher’s skills
(v)	advance my career and become one of the experts in this field
In tune with the objectives of the MC program both scientific achievements and personal advancement are aimed at within STEP"
659722,"Prediction and Anticipation of Actions: Modelling How We Foresee the Others","2016","2018","The ability to understand and predict the actions of others is critical for human social interaction but how the brain accomplishes this function is still poorly understood. This project will explore this fundamental question using an original and innovative approach, by studying how we anticipate the actions of others before they even start to act. The final aim will be to develop a model that integrates different forms of information available before the action starts with kinematic features available once the action has started. To achieve this aim, we will use a combination of EEG/ERP and fMRI that will be integrated through the use of sophisticated source localization software and analysis to obtain a complete picture of when and where each mechanism becomes informative in the brain. This project will shed new light on the study of social cognition by unraveling little studied but crucial aspects of action understanding and prediction. In addition to opening new grounds in the field of social neuroscience and adding theoretical and methodological expertise to my skill-set, the findings and the resultant model of action prediction and social interaction will be useful also beyond social neuroscience. The project could contribute to technological development in the brain computer interface and social robotics fields (e.g. building robots able to smoother interactions), as well as be applied to the understanding of social deficits in psychiatric disorders (i.e. autism and schizophrenic patients). The Social Brain Lab at the Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience (NIN) represents the most suitable environment for this project by providing: world expert in the field of action observation with prominent expertise in the fMRI and EEG techniques (C.Keysers and V. Gazzola); all the technical facilities necessary for the success of the project; a world leading neuroscience community present at the NIN that will contribute to my further training and project development."
659826,"Membrane proteins – development of new computational approaches and its application to G-Protein Coupled Receptors","2016","2018","Protein-protein tridimensional (3D) structures are fundamental for structural biology and drug discovery. Many docking algorithms were developed for that purpose, but they have limited accuracy in generating native-like structures and identifying the most correct one, particularly in the case of membrane proteins such as G-protein Coupled Receptors (GPCRs). In order to deal with these complex systems and overcome the limitations of existing software, we will develop and optimize computational approaches and construct novel combinations of mature methodologies, to serve in the study of membrane proteins in general. In particularly, we will focus in: i) improving the search and scoring algorithms for the docking process of membrane proteins, ii) developing software to accurately predict the high-order oligomers interfacial residues, and iii) constructing a  docking algorithm able to predict their 3D oligomeric structure. Our new approaches will be applied to a relevant biological system: the dopamine receptor type 2 (D2R), a typical member of Class A GPCRs involved in many cognitive, emotional and motor functions. D2R acts by ligand-dependent signalling through two major systems: the G-proteins, and the Arrestin proteins (Arr-s). How ligands determine the preference for one or the other is not yet understood at the molecular level, and this precludes both the characterization of pathway selectivity and the design of biased ligands. More importantly, the physiological relevance of oligomerization for this process is still topic of vigorous debate. Therefore, building on both my unique expertise and Prof. Bonvin well-known impact in methodological development, this project will yield novel methods and approaches to serve in the study of membrane protein systems and their functional mechanisms, benefiting the entire research field. It will also provide truly new fundamental knowledge and insights into the selectivity of D2R signalling."
660411,"USE OF LACTIC ACID BACTERIA AS DELIVERY VEHICLE FOR ORAL VACCINATION OF FISH","2016","2018","This project will provide a proof of principle that food-grade lactic acid bacteria (LAB) can be used as vehicle for oral vaccination of fish and will unravel the underlying mechanisms of memory formation in zebrafish. We will engineer Lactococcus lactis to deliver a DNA- or protein-based prototype vaccine against spring viraemia of carp virus (SVCV). The choice of virus and antigen is based on work showing that injection vaccination with DNA plasmids encoding the G protein of SVCV is highly successful. This vaccination route however, is less suitable for mass delivery and alternative strategies aiming at delivering the vaccine via the oral route are required. Food-grade lactic acid bacteria as vaccine vehicle are an attractive strategy to deliver vaccines at mucosal surfaces that has never been investigated in fish. We will use zebrafish as animal model to monitor real-time vaccine uptake and kinetics of immune responses. Already available knock-out and transgenic zebrafish lines expressing reporter genes under the control of cell- or cytokine-specific promotors will help dissect the contribution of innate and adaptive immune responses induced by vaccination. We will develop novel transgenic zebrafish lines for the controlled ablation of zebrafish cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), to test the hypothesis that long term protective immunity to SVCV is mainly CTL-mediated. Altogether, this project will provide a proof of principle for the development of mucosal vaccines suitable for mass delivery in fish using commensal bacteria, supported by the unravelling of immune mechanisms important for memory formation using zebrafish as animal model. This project will familiarize the candidate with mucosal immunology using state-of-the-art techniques such as transgenesis and live microscopy in an animal model of high interest to the Life Sciences; this will promote his development as independent researcher and facilitate the acquisition of a stable research position in Europe."
660458,"Responding or not responding to training; prediction of balance rehabilitation outcome from structural and functional brain networks in Cerebral Palsy.","2016","2018","When an injury occurs to the developing brain, as in Cerebral Palsy (CP), these children typically experience sensorimotor disorders such as muscle weakness, abnormal muscle activity, and ataxia. Poor balance control is a primary deficit in CP, which has a large impact on a child’s daily life, since it is crucial for independent mobility and greatly affects the risk of falls. CP is the most common developmental cause of physical disability in the world, with a prevalence of 2-3 in 1000 live births. To improve their quality of life, adequate treatment is essential. However, studies investigating the effectiveness of balance rehabilitation in CP have revealed mixed results. This is due to two reasons. First, due to the various clinical scales and experimental measures available, each measuring different components of balance, it is very complex to diagnose balance control in CP. Second, it is currently unknown which are the underlying neural causes of poor balance control in CP.
Since the success of well-targeted treatment depends on this basic knowledge, a novel experiment is suggested that provides fundamental insights in both areas. I will investigate whether balance training can promote postural and gait balance control in CP children. Clinical and experimental measures will be combined to allow for the determination of the best diagnostic tool for imbalance in CP. Using diffusion kurtosis imaging and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging, I will examine the structural and functional brain networks involved in balance control in CP and whether advances in balance control are supported by neuroplastic changes.
As some children will be less responsive to training, it is hypothesized that this innovative combination of behavioral and neurological assessments allows for the identification of the underlying causes of responsiveness, and, most importantly, the prediction of individual responsiveness based on medical brain images, using machine learning."
661010,"Characterising the spatial organisation and regulation of the Wnt receptor complex in stem cells and cancer","2016","2018","Wnts are a family of secreted glycoproteins that control maintenance and proliferation of stem cell reservoirs during tissue homeostasis and regeneration after injury. Deregulated Wnt signalling due to mutations in important signalling intermediates is strongly linked to disease. The complex molecular mechanisms mediating Wnt-induced cell responses are therefore of wide interest and the underlying protein interactions provide attractive drug targets, particularly in regenerative medicine and cancer treatment. 

The earliest events that occur after Wnts bind their receptors at the cell surface, such as receptor endocytosis and recruitment of cytoplasmic effectors, are decisive for downstream gene activation but the underlying mechanisms by which these events process and tune the Wnt signal remain poorly understood. The key objective of this proposal is to resolve critical molecular events that drive initiation of the Wnt cascade in stem and cancer cells. By using a novel tool developed in the Maurice laboratory to detect endogenous Wnt-bound complexes, The Applicant will focus on the following central objectives: 

1. To elucidate Wnt receptor localisation in sub-cellular compartments
2. To examine the regulation of Wnt receptor trafficking and turnover in response to Wnt signalling
3. To investigate how cancer cells exploit Wnt receptor trafficking to drive tumour growth

To meet these objectives, The Applicant will be trained to employ an integrated approach combining biochemistry and genome editing in intestinal organoid cultures with advanced imaging including immuno-electron microscopy to develop a unique set of tools to study Wnt receptor trafficking and turnover at the endogenous level. The expected insights will be vital to understand how pathway activation is controlled and for strategies to interfere with Wnt signalling in disease."
661099,"Macrophage proliferation and ontogeny in murine models of atherosclerosis","2016","2018","Atherosclerosis is a slowly progressing inflammatory disease that underlies some of the most common causes of death in western society. The central role of macrophages throughout its pathogenesis makes this cell an eminent target for therapeutic intervention. Recent studies have subverted the classical view that atherosclerotic plaque macrophages mainly originate from recruited circulating monocytes, launching the new notion that macrophages could also be derived from clonal expansion of resident macrophages or even trans-differentiated vascular smooth muscle cells. The relative importance of these mechanisms to the pathogenesis remains however unclear, due to a lack of adequate animal models that allow assessing this question.
In this project, I introduce a recently developed fate mapping model, the LysMCre-Ubow\/\ mouse, into the atherosclerosis field to conclusively identify regions within the plaque that were formed through local proliferation rather than monocyte recruitment. Apart from quantifying its relative contribution to plaque growth during disease progression and regression, I will furthermore characterize the localization, transcriptional activity and the lipidic makeup of these proliferated cells versus invaded monocytes. 
In a second part of this project, I will deploy adoptive bone marrow transfers from WT to Ubow mice and vice versa as a model to quantify intraplaque myeloid versus stromal-cell derived macrophages. I will compare proliferative capacity, phenotype, transcriptomics and lipidomics of these two subsets and link this information to their functionality.
With this strategy I will be the first to reveal the impact of the three macrophage accumulation mechanisms throughout the disease course, to couple this to their function and to exploit this knowledge for targeted experimental therapeutic interventions."
661588,"Predicting Cardiotoxicity Induced by Kinase Inhibitors: From Systems Biology to Systems Pharmacology","2015","2018","Kinase inhibitors (KIs) are a major class of highly effective anti-cancer drugs. Unfortunately, therapeutic use of KIs is often associated with cardiotoxicity (CT), a serious adverse condition which limits their use. This fellowship aims to develop mathematical systems pharmacology models for KI-induced CT. These models will be used to identify predictive CT signatures that will allow to decrease CT risk of new KIs. This innovative multi-disciplinary approach consists of integrating mathematical systems pharmacology modelling, with state-of-the-art experimental data generation. To this aim, KIs with different magnitudes of CT will be selected based on clinical adverse event databases. Human cardiomyocytes derived from pluripotent stem cells will then be treated with the selected KIs and in combination with CT modifying drugs. The effect of these treatments on changes on untargeted mRNA and protein expression will be measured and then analyzed using network modelling. This approach allows identification of key regulatory proteins. The selected proteins will then be quantified over time along with cardiomyocyte health markers. With this data, dynamical models will be developed to capture the relationship between exposure to KIs and the effects on protein expression and cardiomyocyte health over time. Ultimately these models will allow generation of predictive network-based dynamically-weighted signatures for CT.
The fellow aims to establish himself as independent researcher in systems pharmacology. Training in state-of-the-art computational and experimental technologies at the leading systems pharmacology group at Mount Sinai in New York will fundamentally strengthen and broaden the experience of the fellow. This project will significantly contribute consolidate the career track of the fellow, foster future collaboration between Mount Sinai and Leiden University, and disseminate training in Europe."

In the EXPECT-HEALTH project, my research group is unravelling the central mechanisms of how expectations affect immune and endocrine responses and related health outcomes, through the use of pioneering multidisciplinary methods in healthy and clinical populations. Ultimate goal of gaining this knowledge is to apply it in innovative therapeutic interventions. 

In order to reach this goal, an innovative multimodal training tool based on the dual expectancy learning approach (including implicit and explicit processes) proposed in the EXPECT-HEAL-TH project will be developed and brought to the pre-demonstration phase, making optimal use of new technology including implicit and explicit methods in the area of eHealth and serious gaming. I propose this proof of concept, termed TRAIN-HEAL-TH, to facilitate the design and development process in 4 stages: 1) development of innovative training tools, 2) usability and functionality testing of multimodal training tools, 3) pilot feasibility testing of multimodal training tools in relevant target populations and improving training tools based on pilot testing, and 4) evaluation of potential commercialisation opportunities. 

This interdisciplinary, cross-boundary project aims to design a training tool that can be applied in healthy as well as clinical populations. The development process, including potential professional commercialisation opportunities, will be facilitated and evaluated in this study using state of the art knowledge within the field of eHealth and serious gaming. The project will result in a multimodal training tool that may be tailored to individual target populations for disease prevention and improvement of health outcomes. For the first time, the theoretical underpinnings of EXPECT-HEAL-TH are translated into innovative therapeutic tools that have potential for a broad range of societal and economic benefits."
693039,"Development of a potent dual GCS/GBA2 inhibitor as a best in class Gaucher therapeutic","2016","2018","Gaucher disease (GD) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by deficient activity of acid glucosylceramidase (GBA1). Most patients feature a non-neuronopathic (type 1) course of disease and are treated by either enzyme replacement therapy (ERT – administration of recombinant GBA1) or substrate reduction therapy (SRT – treatment with the iminosugar, Zavesca or the ceramide mimic, Eliglustat – inhibitors of glucosylceramide synthase (GCS)). These therapeutic agents do not prevent neurological symptoms in patients suffering from neuronopathic Gaucher forms (types 2/3) and there is thus an unmet medical need for these patients. Potent GCS inhibitors reduce glucosylceramide (GlcCer), the substrate of GBA and the storage material in Gaucher, and also higher glycosphingolipids including gangliosides and globosides, the causative storage materials in Tay-Sachs disease, GM1 gangliosidosis and Fabry disease. We have found a highly attractive lead, BiPheDNM 7 (Figure C below), which we plan to further develop towards a phase I/II clinical candidate. This proof of concept project will result in a packet comprising this lead molecule, accompanied by all the relevant data and tools to start phase I/II clinical development together with a pharmaceutical partner."

This Anger Reduction Tool (ART) will consist of a ‘serious game’ that trains people to make avoidance movements to angry faces. The ART will be commercialized through a freemium model, such that it will be made freely available, while users can purchase additional functionalities using bio- and neuro-feedback modules. The ART will be marketed to mental health professionals with clients who are not willing or able to respond to traditional cognitive interventions, such as high school children or lower-educated violent offenders. By harnessing the possibilities of smart technology, the ART allows people to become co-managers of their (mental) health and well-being."

The interdisciplinary scientific goal of the project is to introduce the concept of “digital (cultural and literary) trauma processing” and develop the scientific field of “digital trauma studies” at the intersection of digital memory studies and cultural trauma studies; based on the outcomes of the two way knowledge transfer in the training-through research of the applicant, who is an expert on literary and cultural trauma studies, at the leading research centre of cultural and digital memory studies at the University of Amsterdam.
The TRAPRODIG project is of clear relevance to the Marie Sklodowska-Curie actions programme as it will contribute to a better understanding of the link of current cultural developments to the collective traumas of the past in post-socialist countries; it draws attention to the voices of contemporary migrants within the European cultural framework; and it will also add significantly to the mapping of trauma literature and life narratives in Europe by analysing how the 21st century digital environment influences both personal and collective trauma processing in local, national and trans-national communities within Europe."
702139,"Interactions between von Neumann algebras and quantum algebras","2016","2018","During his construction of a solid mathematical theory behind - the at that time completely new - quantum mechanics, von Neumann introduced his eponymous algebras to describe observable quantities. These “von Neumann algebras” became a basic tool in various other branches of mathematics, including Lie theory (the theory of continuous symmetries), non-commutative geometry (a “quantum” version of classical differential geometry), and, surprisingly, the theory of knots, for which V. Jones received a Fields Medal.  

Strangely enough, although the theory of von Neumann algebras is quite pervasive in mathematics and mathematical physics, their actual construction and classification remains largely shrouded in mystery (despite deep work on classification by A. Connes, also getting him a Fields Medal). Particularly unsatisfactory is that the types of von Neumann algebras that are most relevant to quantum mechanics, so-called “type III”-algebras, are very rare. 

With this Marie-Curie fellowship, I pick up the two challenges of construction and classification, especially focussing on Connes' famous rigidity conjecture for lattices in Lie groups as well as type III von Neumann algebras, using two entirely new approaches. The first is the use of finite-dimensional approximations, that I used previously in a different context (studying the Haagerup property and Lp-Fourier multipliers). The second new approach is based on the theory of quantum groups. 

Utrecht University (host institution) is the unique place in Europe housing both experts in non-commutative analysis and Lie theory, and thereby provides exactly the necessary (complementary) expertise that is necessary to attack these deep and profound problems.

The results will have a lasting impact on and connect further the theories of non-commutative geometry, operator algebras, Lie theory, quantum group theory and partly quantum physics."

In order to decrease this enormous quantity, medical imaging should be widely available at early diagnostics and every stage of a therapy. Nowadays, there are various diagnostics techniques including CT, PET, MRI, however, analysis of a medical image is time-consuming and expensive. Development of new effective automatic tool for medical imaging will appear a new strategy in highly specific control of incidences and disease progression. The aim of the DeeBMED project is to develop powerful automatic medical imaging tool that can cope with main problems associated with complex images like medical scans: multimodality of data distribution, large number of dimension and small number of examples, small amount of labeled data, multi-source learning, and robustness to transformations. In this project I will propose a probabilistic framework that combines different deep neural networks (DNN), such as feedforward nets, convolutional nets, Gaussian processes. I will apply DNN to model probabilistic relationships among a medical scan, a disease label, and hidden variables representing latent factors in data. In the case of a small sample size DNN are prone to overfitting. A possible remedy for that is Bayesian learning, however, it is still challenging how to apply it to DNN. In this project I will use various approaches: modelling weights uncertainty, Dropout, Bayesian Distillation. As the result I predict identification of the first highly effective medical imaging analysis tool that in the future will be widely used by radiologists in medical institutes in the whole EU. Novel automation will drastically reduce time and costs of analysis and provide more accessible diagnostics. The project will be carried out at the University of Amsterdam, under the supervision of Prof. Max Welling."

Existing psychological and neuroimaging studies have focused on the humanlikeness dimension of UV but neglected its emotional experience, which was at the heart of the original hypothesis. This interdisciplinary project will develop a thorough model for the emotional dimension of UV, consisting both of subjective verbal descriptions and observed neuronal activation patterns. A series of neuroimaging experiments will be carried out at the Brain and Emotion Laboratory of Maastricht University (UM): the first experiment will test the neuronal correlates of negative emotions elicited by semi-realistic virtual characters, and the second experiment will take a step beyond the original UV hypothesis by comparing the neuronal activation patterns of real and virtual emotional expressions. A self-report questionnaire for verbalizing the emotional experience of UV will be developed during a secondment period at Eindhoven University of Technology (Tu/e). By explicating the emotional experience of UV and by providing open tools for both research and industry, this project will be an important turning point for the future development of all humanlike technologies. Consistently, direct and concrete contacts with the animation industry are planned during the project. My supervisor Prof. de Gelder from UM is one of the thought leaders in the field of affective cognitive neuroscience, and my secondment supervisor Prof. Ijsselsteijn from Tu/e is renowned for his work in human-technology interaction. I am an experienced researcher with a dual background in both of these disciplines, as well as specific background in UV topic. This interdisciplinary synergy will maximize this project’s impact on the European society and help establish my position as a leading independent scientist."
703999,"Evolution of sexual dimorphisms: all about losing not choosing?","2016","2018","Males and females often differ dramatically in phenotype, with one sex exhibiting elaborate ornaments absent in the other. Darwin suggested such dimorphism evolves through sexual selection on males to attract females and repel rival males. Ever since, this framework served to explain why males are showy and females drab. Song in songbirds was a classic example (males sing and females are silent) until our recent research showed that female song is phylogenetically widespread and probably ancestral. Thus, current sex differences in song must have at least partly resulted from females evolving away from males by losing song. Therefore, the key question is not what has led to elaboration in males, but rather, what is responsible for losses in females. I will engage a network of experts from three EU institutions and the general public to participate in addressing this new, pertinent question of trait loss in a large-scale phylogenetic analysis across songbirds. I will focus on three goals important to progress in this field: (1) develop an urgently needed single quantitative score to compare song structure among species, (2) determine how gains and losses of song structure in each sex contribute to overall dimorphism, (3) compare dimorphism to a broad range of ecological and natural history correlates. From the host and partners, I will receive expert training through research in animal communication, bioacoustics, and character evolution, including advanced sound analysis tools during a Secondment and leadership training through a major citizen science project with xeno-canto, the world’s largest bird song database. This inclusive mentorship and training will equip me with diversified and advanced skills to contribute to this important research question and embark on my career goals of leading an independent, integrated research programme in behavioural ecology and evolution."

Impact of Complementary Currencies","2016","2018","This research seeks to measure and analyse the social and economic impact of selected Community Currencies in Europe with the use of a self-assessment Total Quality Management model called Common Assessment Framework. Complementary Currencies (CC) are a type of money designed to circulate alongside the Central Bank’s money to address objectives that the conventional money system does not. CC are tied to a specific demarcated community (i.e. locality, mutual-credit networks, sectoral vouchers). The Common Assessment Framework (CAF) engages the organisation and its beneficiaries and performs a study of its structure and operation at a particular point in time and place.
The study will further organizational theory for sustainability and community building, contributing to the Europe 2020 strategy. It builds upon previous efforts funded by the European Union, namely Digipay4growth  and CCIA, by studying the social and economic impact of these projects in order to further theorise CC from a systems and complexity theory perspective. The research will link micro-impact indicators at an organizational level, such as employment generation and access to financial services, with macro indicators at the national level, such as the enhanced GDP that includes well-being and life satisfaction, according to the Beyond GDP initiative of the European Commission. 
The research on CCs as an anti-crisis mechanism is topical at a time when the European Union member states and especially Greece are striving to cope with the financial crisis and its impact on national economies and societies. Several countries have experienced GDP declines and rising unemployment rates, while in Greece the indicators are even worse than during the Great Depression. In that line, the priorities of Europe 2020 include community currencies because of their effectiveness towards social innovation, new modes of sustainable economy, employment and enterprise creation, and local regeneration."
705010,"Distracted drivers in autonomous cars: Do drivers safely detect and react to unexpected warning signals?","2016","2018","Self-driving, or autonomous, cars promise sustained individual mobility while decreasing the risk of accidents due to human error. Their technological development tops the agendas of European governments and car manufacturers. With technology taking centre stage it is easy to overlook the human driver. However, this would be a grave mistake, as autonomous vehicles still require human action. Specifically, the next frontier in autonomous vehicles is a car that controls the vehicle (e.g., steering, acceleration) and monitors the traffic environment, but that can signal a request for human intervention at any time. Little is known about how drivers detect and react to such unexpected signals. Research on lower levels of automation (e.g., cars with cruise control) suggests that reaction times to unexpected signals tend to be slow. It is, however, not clear what causes this slowdown, especially at higher levels of automation. Is this a failure to detect the signal, or a failure to react timely?
My research will identify under what conditions participants (fail to) detect and react to unexpected audio intervention signals. I will measure detection using cognitive neuroscience techniques (Event Related Brain Potentials) and reaction using reaction time in a driving simulator. I will use this innovative method to study detection and reaction in three studies that look at three important factors: the level of automation, the level of distraction of the driver, and the driver's impulsivity and tendency to get distracted. The project combines my expertise on driver distraction and multitasking with Utrecht University's expertise on cognitive neuroscience. The results will provide fundamental insights about human behaviour in higher-level automated vehicles before these systems are released on the road. This knowledge will inform the design of safer technology and better policy for autonomous vehicles."

To achieve this a rational target-guided chemical biology approach will be developed that combines the concepts of fragment-based drug discovery with bioorthogonal synthesis. The significances of achieving this aim are two-fold. First, it would provide valuable tool or lead compounds to aid the maturation of this interaction as a clinical target. Secondly, it would provide a rational and efficient approach for the discovery of PPI stabilisers in general. This under-explored area of pharmaceutical research has the potential to deliver new medicines for the treatment of diseases such as cancer which pose a major societal challenge in Europe. 

The project will combine the powerful tools of synthetic chemistry, biophysical assay techniques and protein crystallography in the true ethos of chemical biology for drug discovery. It will provide the Fellow with excellent experimental training in this increasingly important field, complimenting his proven track-record in synthetic organic chemistry research. Therefore this proposal seeks support to embark on an innovative, integrated and multidisciplinary programme of research which will allow for the consolidation and expansion of the experiences gained by the Fellow during his brief tenure at the ideally suited Laboratory of Chemical Biology, the Technical University of Eindhoven (TU/e).  This Fellowship is a crucial opportunity to enhance the Fellow’s creative and innovative potential thus allowing him to establish an independent research career at the interface of synthetic chemistry and the study of biological systems."
705630,"Beyond the blob: characterizing Prefrontal Cortex networks in prediction and motivation with simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings","2016","2018","Neural correlates of goal-directed behavior have been extensively studied with functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). This has allowed identifying the functional specialization of subregions in prefrontal cortex (PFC). In particular, medial PFC (MPFC) is involved in error monitoring, cognitive control, reward prediction and motivation, while dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC) supports working memory and goal-maintenance. Though useful, such characterization has neglected one fundamental aspect: network interactions. A mechanistic understanding of how MPFC and DLPFC interact in orchestrating goal-directed behavior is still lacking. Both regions seem to be involved in both prediction and error signalling mechanism, and in motivation-driven task-preparation. To date, no theoretical account has reconciled these findings, nor explained how MPFC and DLPFC interact in producing such effects. Here we propose a novel framework, where error signals generated by MPFC train error representations in DLPFC. These representations are reactivated when the same circumstance recurs and drive proportional MPFC involvement to prevent the error from happening again (by deploying adequate neural resources). The goal of the project is to test this theory by combining the excellent spatial resolution of fMRI with the excellent temporal precision of EEG in conjunction with precise quantitative predictions based on computational models of PFC. Simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings will allow testing PFC network dynamics, both in a simple sensory prediction paradigm, and in a paradigm modulating motivation, aiming at demonstrating a shared underlying principle. This research programme will provide a neurofunctional characterization of how PFC network interactions drive goal-directed behaviour in both prediction and motivated task engagement. This work has important implications for future studies on PFC both in healthy subjects and in patients with motivation disorders."
705805,"IMPACT OF BUIDING BLOCK SHAPE ON SELF-ASSEMBLY KINETICS","2016","2018","Self-assembly is a spontaneous arrangement of building blocks into ordered structures. Shape of the building block is one of the key factors, determining the structure of resulting assembly. During the process of self-assembly, the building blocks move through thermal motion and, once in contact, adjust their mutual positions and orientations to minimize free energy and form ordered structure. Increasing shape anisotropy of the building block gradually hinders its reorientation during the process and increases the energy barriers. I propose to study the impact of increasing anisotropy of building blocks on their ability to overcome kinetic barriers during self-assembly process and reach equilibrium. Systematic experimental study will be performed with two dimensional Brownian dispersions of platelet microparticles. The platelets will have irregular pentagonal shape of such geometry that allows complete filling of the plane (valid solutions of pentagonal tiling problem). The shape anisotropy of the microparticles will be gradually increased (decreasing symmetry and circularity, increasing complexity of ordered pattern) and the effect on self-assembly kinetics will be evaluated. Proposed study is the first, systematically revealing relation between shape anisotropy and self-assembly kinetics. Its results will enable new fundamental insights into self-assembly of complex shapes.
Proposed self-assembly experiments require large quantities of microparticles of complex shapes and, simultaneously, not larger than a Brownian limit (~micron). Thus, I propose to develop novel low-cost high-throughput synthetic procedure, utilizing stop-flow lithography for production of Brownian silica particles. The host group participance in the project is vital as it is currently the only laboratory in Europe, working with stop-flow lithography. Furthermore, self-assembly is the main research theme in the host group, thus I can rely on their excellence in both parts of proposed project."
706908,"Migration Of Molecules In Coatings","2016","2018","Because of high damage caused by corrosion, polymer protective coatings are materials of great importance. There is growing interest to search for high-performance coatings with less toxic anticorrosive additives (pigments) than commonly used chromates. The main obstacle in design of novel systems is the lack of understanding of fundamental transport phenomena of pigments in the coatings. 
The project MOMIC (Migration Of Molecules In Coatings) aims at investigating the migration mechanism of anticorrosive additives through polymer coatings. Two model systems will be investigated in order to meet this goal, namely isolated particles system, in which the transport phenomena in polymer matrix will be studied and clustered particles system which is a model reflecting commercial coating formulations. In order to evaluate the migration pathways through the coatings two measurement approaches will be employed. The depletion of the pigment particles will be studied with X-ray Computational Tomography (XCT) combined with Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)-based sectioning technique. The molecular migration will be followed with a combination of chemical imaging techniques such as Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM), (Confocal) Raman and Infrared Spectroscopy.
The project will result in establishing the mechanisms for model systems which are envisioned to be applied to characterise transport phenomena in commercial coatings. This will allow to design coatings with functional additives as well as improve their anticorrosive performance."

Perceiving the future and the development of early modern capitalism, 1500-1700","2016","2018","Back2theFuture will develop a new research agenda on the perceptions of the future in the early modern Low Countries. A careful analysis of the semantics of expressions about the future will verify whether the future began to be perceived as malleable, a transition fundamental to the development of capitalism. This project goes beyond the research by intellectual and cultural historians who have focused on 1) the revolutionary eighteenth century; 2) the learned texts and philosophies of history written by the intelligentsia; 3) divination and magic; and 4) the long-term future namely eschatological expectations. If one agrees with the common opinion of social and economic historians that the Low Countries witnessed the early development of capitalism from the late medieval period onward, than it is necessary to look into the beliefs of more ordinary people prior to the eighteenth century.
The project draws on a sizeable source collection of merchant correspondence, selected letters from the 'Prize Papers' and almanacs from the period 1500-1700. The texts will be close-read, expressions about the future will be selected and entered into a database which will include variables about the semantics and future horizons of these expressions. The project has three key outcomes: 1) a fuller understanding of people’s perception of the future and how they thought and wrote about it; 2) it can be (dis)proven whether a shift in thoughts and beliefs about the future interacted with nascent capitalism in the region; 3) a new methodology based on the integration of economic and cultural history and historical sociolinguistics which can be applied to other sources and other European regions. 
Back2theFuture is fully cross-disciplinary. The fellow will acquire a range of new skills, both scholarly and in management which will decisively improve the fellow’s academic and scientific career. Leiden University will benefit from both the project and the fellow’s expertise andnetwork."

Self-driving personal cars that coordinate themselves to eliminate road accidents while doubling the capacity of highways; swarms of autonomous flying machines that quickly map and explore critical areas during emergency response; fleets of service robots that inspect, clean or repair large infrastructures or vessels in a fraction of the time needed to do this manually. These are just a few examples of so called robotic ensembles, and that have the potential of revolutionizing our life in a short time span. But a key factor that can prevent them to deliver their expected benefit, is un-safety. What if such complex collective systems may be made unusable, or even dangerous, by failures or misbehaviours of a few, or even a single of their members? Threats may come from simple and inevitable physical damage occurring to individual units, or may even be the result of the deliberate action of compromised ones, due to malicious cyber-attacks directed at disrupting the service provided by the ensemble. Eradicating such scenarios is precisely the objective of the present proposal, that by directing the fellow research effort to the conception and analysis of an innovative multi-scale, adaptive and distributed diagnosis approach, will actively contribute to the creation of Safe Unmanned Robotic Ensembles (SURE). Delft University of Technology (TUD), combining top-level expertise in modelling and control of vehicular traffic flows, in distributed robotic applications, and in the conduction of robotic test-beds at its world-class experimental facilities, is a unique institution. The one where the researcher will be able to prove the effectiveness of the proposed safety techniques by operating a laboratory scale robotic test-bed. This will pave the way, within the Dutch Automated Vehicle Initiative, for trials on actual cooperative self-driving cars, a motivating example that is projected to be worth 71 billions of Euros in 2030."
707562,"The Power of Silence: A Medical Anthropological Approach to AIDS Care Narratives","2017","2018","Despite the widespread availability of antiretroviral medication, the global AIDS epidemic has not been halted yet and stigmatization of people living with HIV and AIDS continues in most parts of the world. While the social scientific analysis of narratives of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) has proven crucial in understanding challenges in AIDS care worldwide, the silences that structure such narratives remain under-theorized. Current studies signal that silences may be defenses and active strategies rather than passive responses to stigma, but critical questions remain on how to study, conceptualize and interpret what is unspeakable and unspoken, and sometimes even unthinkable. 
 
This project develops novel analytical tools to understand silences in illness narratives. It is based on empirical data gathered in Indonesia and New York. Its objectives are threefold:

1) To conceptualize how silences shape AIDS care, by analyzing narratives of PLWHA and caregiving institutions (conceptual/empirical goal)
2) To theorize the relation between silence and narrative (theoretical goal)
3) To develop a qualitative methodology for recognizing, inquiring into, and understanding respondents’ silences (epistemological/methodological goal) 

In order to reach these objectives, the researcher will receive advanced training at Harvard University, which is on the forefront of developing multidisciplinary scientific research on HIV/AIDS and narrative theory. The expertise developed at Harvard University will strengthen the medical anthropology program of the University of Amsterdam, which houses the return phase of the project. The project will enhance the career opportunities of the researcher and promises to make significant contributions to the understanding of narratives and silences in AIDS care. These insights are highly relevant for policymakers in the global fight against AIDS and for social scientists who work in the field of global medicine."
708045,"Tensionless strings of six-dimensional superconformal theories","2016","2018","Despite the important role they play in M-theory, six-dimensional superconformal field theories (SCFTs) are to this day not well understood. A characteristic feature of 6d SCFTs is that their degrees of freedom include tensionless strings; while some properties of these strings have been studied in recent years, the 2d SCFTs that govern their behavior have not been constructed. In this proposal I outline a research plan to determine the 2d theories governing the strings, and use this knowledge to study the dynamics of six-dimensional SCFTs.

I also explore two important applications of this class of 2d SCFTs. First, I will determine whether a conventional gravity dual to such 2d theories under the AdS3/CFT2 correspondence exists. I will then use the 2d SCFTs to study the properties of their gravity duals and establish whether such gravity duals behave as string theories, thus testing the string universality conjecture for 3d quantum gravity.

Second, I will use one of the 2d SCFTs under consideration to investigate the Mathieu moonshine conjecture. This conjecture connects two seemingly unrelated areas of mathematics: mock modular forms and representation theory of the Mathieu group M24. It is expected that this deep mathematical relation will be explained by an appropriate string theory construction; I argue that the 2d SCFT under consideration can be expected to play a role in the proof.

The research will take place at the University of Amsterdam’s Institute of Physics. The Institute hosts some of the world’s top experts on the proposed research topics. The project will be conducted by combining techniques from their areas of research with my expertise on six-dimensional SCFTs and their tensionless strings. The research program includes a strong training plan and a clear transfer of knowledge, and will contribute to reinforce European excellence in theoretical high-energy physics."
708193,"Beta-cell inflammation and dysfunction induced by bacterial translocation","2016","2018","Type 2 diabetes (T2D) has risen to epidemic proportions resulting in major morbidity and mortality. In addition to insulin resistance (i.e. impaired insulin action), impaired function and destruction of the insulin-producing beta cells form the direct cause for hyperglycemia and T2D, and causes the progressive course of disease. As such, due to continuous beta-cell destruction, many patients require treatment with exogenous insulin therapy. Clearly, therapies that may halt or reverse this detrimental process are warranted.
An inflammatory process in islets of Langerhans, with infiltration of immune cells and a central role for toll-like receptors (TLR), is present in T2D, however, the primary trigger for this inflammatory response remains unknown. Recently, (diet-induced) alterations in intestinal microbiota composition were shown to associate with T2D. In addition, T2D patients have increased translocation of detrimental bacteria (‘leaky gut’), previously shown to induce adipose tissue inflammation and dysfunction.
Recently, I hypothesized that increased bacterial translocation to the pancreas induces inflammation and beta-cell dysfunction in T2D through TLR related mechanisms. I addressed this hypothesis first by identifying translocated microorganism DNA in pancreatic tissue harvested during pancreatectomy in patients with and without T2D. In pilot data, I have demonstrated increased bacterial load in patients with T2D as compared to control patients. The involved micro organisms with highest pathogenicity will be (an)aerobically cultured and subsequently used in gavage studies in a obese mouse model with or without a knockout for TRL4 to study their effects effects on beta-cell function, glucose metabolism and pancreas inflammation."

Despite previous efforts to recapitulate tumorigenesis with the use of mouse models and cancer cell lines, the exact mechanisms that underlie BRCA1 or BRCA2-dependent tumor development remain unclear. 

Recent advances in stem cell culturing have enabled long-term expansion of in vitro human breast organoids or ‘mini-breasts’. In a novel approach, this state-of-the-art culture technology will be used together with CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene-editing and human-in-mouse xenografts to prospectively recapitulate early breast cancer development. Results of the study will generate novel fundamental insight into the development of breast cancer, support the development of personalized medicine using laboratory models, and aspires to identify novel breast cancer biomarkers and treatment strategies.

The expertise of the laboratory of H. Clevers, who pioneered the organoid methodology and works at the top of the field of stem cell biology, will be combined with the expertise of the research group of J. Visvader and G. Lindeman, world leaders in the field of breast cancer research and experts in the methodology of mammary xenotransplantation. This unique setting  forms an excellent envorinment for my postdoctoral research training, allows extensive knowledge exchange and provides opportunities for novel research lines and collaborations."

The technical solution proposed by HCI is the 4FOLD foldable container. This concept is IP protected by HCI by 8 patents. This proposal fits within the topic Small business innovation research for Transport-IT-1-2015 of the work programme Smart Green & Integrated Transport. 
4 folded 4FOLD containers stacked have the same dimensions as 1 container, enabling the reduction of transport movements up to 75%. An increase of the shipping lines’ profit margin of 600% is possible, corresponding to savings up to 25% on the operational costs and 27% on the total CO2 emissions of container transport at sea. 
A reduction of 25% on operational costs can be achieved, giving an huge economic boost to the EU logistics sector and the total EU economy. The 4FOLD strengthens the EU transport sector by making container transport more time and cost efficient, creating new jobs and tackling the mentioned environmental and mobility defies. 
The 4FOLD prototype is at TRL7 and will be demonstrated in an operational environment in 5 international trial projects. The overall goal of the Phase2 project is to catalyse the market uptake of the 4FOLD container. A large scale demonstration is necessary to convince the conservative logistics sector of the added value and usability of the 4FOLD and opens the market for this innovation. For Phase2 HCI has involved key players to execute the demonstration project and develop the market implementation: market leaders in container manufacturing and global transport companies. HCI is frontrunner in the development of foldable containers and aims to expand its market leadership to the sales of 500,000 4FOLDs annually by 2030. This represents >27% of the complete newly built 40ft containers in 2013. The long term ambition of HCI is complete replacement of the conventional 40ft container."

CONQUEST is formed around a new imaging technology platform. The basis is the newly developed nanoparticles function as contrast agents for a variety of imaging modalities that are presently used in healthcare such as ultrasound and MRI. In particular, the nanoparticles are a completely novel type of contrast agent for ultrasound imaging. The high stability and long shelf life of the particles combined with visibility in ultrasound could allow application of ultrasound imaging in areas currently dominated by more expensive, more difficult and slower imaging modalities such as MRI, PET or SPECT (nuclear imaging techniques). Moreover, ultrasound is already widely available, does not involve ionizing radiation and is the most “user-friendly” clinical imaging modality. Furthermore, the unique properties of the CONQUEST nanoparticles may allow its targeting to regions of inflammation, including malignant tumours and unstable atherosclerotic plaques. Initially, we will focus on the application of CONQUEST agents to the diagnosis of focal liver lesions. Currently, through the linked ERC StG, GMP-grade particles are available and approved for testing in a cell therapy clinical trial.
 
In all, at the end of this proposal, we expect to have solid in vivo proof of the viability of the agent in focal liver lesions (selected as our first application based on market research), and a strengthened IP position. This will put CONQUEST in a strong position to acquire the large amounts of funding necessary for full clinical validation, and the eventual introduction of new applications and new products.
 
Thus, with this technology platform we can create a new market (for multimodal imaging agents), improve efficiency and reduce costs in healthcare."

With average drug development costs of over $2 billion dollar and a 95% failure rate of cancer drugs in Phase I trials, a new paradigm is highly needed.
iGOLDD represents a unique opportunity for the commercialisation of a powerful alternative drug-delivery solution that has the potential to locally boost the efficacy of many drugs for a range of clinical indications. Prof. Moonen and his team, as part of the ERC project Sound Pharma, have developed a powerful technology platform, based on magnetic resonance guided focused ultrasound (MR-HIFU), that can be used for high-precision image-guided drug delivery, HIFU is the only known technique capable of completely non-invasive, precisely controlled heating deep inside the human body. MRI allows continuous imaging of the tumour and surrounding health tissue for target definition. 
iGOLDD aims to commercialise this unique technology as a stand-alone drug delivery platform that can be widely offered to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to improve new or existing drugs or reuse shelved therapies. In iGOLDD we will further optimise the HIFU technology (in particular temperature control and motion correction) for drug delivery of macromolecular drugs, such as antibody-drug conjugates, to demonstrate the large potential of our drug delivery platform. In addition, we will prepare for market introduction, by defining the exact business strategy, model and positioning for commercial success. We will develop the business strategy that offers the most promise, based on the technological aspects of the project, the market needs and trends, the end-user needs and the IP-position. During this project, we will gain technical and commercial proof-of-concept, which will provide us with the necessary information regarding potential commercialisation routes."

The choice for treatment depends on the subtype of GBM. An accurate detection of tumour subtype is therefore essential for a personalised targeted treatment. Diagnosis, classification and treatment monitoring occurs currently by radiology and repeated invasive biopsies. There is a need for non-invasive, actionable biomarkers for early-stage diagnosis and disease monitoring.
During our ERC research, we discovered that mRNA sequenced from tumour-educated platelets enables for pan-cancer, multiclass cancer and companion diagnostics. We were able to distinguish between primary and metastasised tumours in the brain and also establish the molecular subtype of the tumour. These findings provide strong support for using tumour-educated platelets as a biomarker for early stratification, diagnosis and prognosis for personalised GBM treatment.

As a proof-of-concept of our innovative diagnostic tests, we will validate the proprietary algorithms underlying these tests specifically in GBM patients. To achieve this, we focus on the differentiation of glioblastoma subtype based on the platelet mRNA profile. In addition we will validate treatment monitoring and response prediction to an EGFR targeted drug in GBM patients.

GlioDx will also assess the feasibility to commercialise the technology. The team has developed several business and IP models which need to be assessed thoroughly through in-depth market research and business planning activities. The results need to be consolidated into a strong business plan that will be presented to investors and strategic investors."

This allows the culturing and in vitro functional analysis of neuronal networks that mimic the human brain in a physiologically much more relevant way than conventional cell culture systems or animal models. Therefore, the  MESOTAS-SIEVE system has great potential towards the realisation of tissue models of the brain for drug efficacy and toxicity assays.
 This project is based on exciting discoveries done in the ERC Starting Grant project MESOTAS (2011-2016). In MESOTAS, a bioreactor on a microelectrode array (MEA) has been developed to study the ‘natural’ behaviour of 3D neuronal networks. For this bioreactor, a neuronal cell line has been identified that uniquely survives >30 days and forms neuronal networks. To further improve function and network formation capacity, this project will integrate a micro-sieve at the bottom of the MESOTAS bioreactor to improve cell shape, function and optimal connection to the MEA electrodes for single-cell readout of activity. PoC of this MESOTAS-SIEVE bioreactor provides the basis for further development towards a commercial brain-on-a-chip platform. 
 The first steps towards commercialization of MESOTAS-SIEVE will be performed as part of this project and initial industry contact are already in place.

Despite the recent advances in low-cost integrated circuits, the poor performance of on-chip antennas is nowadays the major bottleneck in converting the electrical signals (on-chip) into radiated ones (off-chip). For decades the problem of “surface waves” has prevented the efficient use of radiators on chip. 
The AD-HOC project aims at exploiting the breakthrough technology of Artificial Dielectric (AD) layers as the solution to the surface-wave problem of High-frequency On-Chip antennas. The processes necessary to micro-fabricate AD layers will be optimized with the goal of achieving reliable manufacturing, while offering design flexibility at low costs. This will allow the wide exploitation of the AD layers, as they can be used by industrial technology providers as add-on components to at least double the efficiency of their integrated circuit front ends. 
By overcoming the fundamental limitation of integrated antennas, AD layers have high potential to become a “standard” component in all future car-safety and wireless-communication devices. The AD-HOC project will bring this innovative technology to a pre-demonstration stage to strengthen commercialization and scaling-up opportunities."

As such it complements and supports the pillars on efficient and sustainable transport means and operations. 
The required integration and enhancement of the European transport infrastructure networks needs a shift towards next levels of governance capabilities that can adequately address the key societal challenges. In the framework of this CSA on a life cycle based asset management approach for transport infrastructure networks, these challenges are related to: 
An unprecedented call for network capacity and performance
An unprecedented call for transparent, coherent and consistent decision making on cost-performance
The (mostly public) financing of the transport infrastructure system has met with concrete fiscal limits. Already in many countries in the EU, this has led to a backlog in maintenance and replacement. Unless decisive actions are taken on network construction, maintenance and operations, this trend will result in mounting congestion losses in the economic powerhouses on the short term and to prohibitive  obstructions in transport flows across the European transport network on the medium term. This calls for cross asset, cross modal and cross border decision making by the appropriate authorities, implying their close coordination and collaboration. The precondition for this is transparency to each other as well as to policy and society. This requires them to share a common vision and objectives, in a common language and from a common information base.
The governance challenge is to provide the key stakeholders in the infrastructure governance with appropriate data, methods and tools in order to enable their decision making on cost-performance to be transparent, coherent and consistent across the assets, across the modes, and across the borders."
715070,"Experimental characterization of turbulent pressure fluctuations on realistic Contra-Rotating Open Rotor (CROR) 2D airfoil in representative high subsonic Mach number","2016","2018","Prediction of Open Rotor broadband noise requires  boundary layer statistics that, for the high subsonic relative Mach number encountered by the blades, are not available today in literature. The CRORTET project, fills this lack by preparing and executing a high fidelity wind tunnel test, analyse the results and deliver a well documented data base with test data. 
One of the major sources of broadband noise is due to the deformation and interaction of the turbulent vortices in the rotor blade boundary layer when they pass over the blade trailing edge. Existing semi-analytical models for the prediction of broadband traling edge noise emission require turbulence statistics of the surface pressures close to the trailing edge, namely: the fluctuation spectrum, convection velocity and spanwise correlation length of the surface pressures. Existing experimental data were made on flat plates, NACA0012 or similar airfoils at low Mach number, No experimental data nor high fidelity simulations are available for the high subsonic Mach conditions encountered by the rotor blades operating in approach (0.5), take-off (0.7) and cruise (0.9) conditions. Applying semi-analytical methods to these conditions, using inappropriate surface pressure statistics shows a shortfall in comparison to open rotor experimental data. It is thought that this is mainly due to the use of low Mach number data on profiles too much different from CROR blade profiles.
Therefore, in the CRORTET project two airfoils will be specifically designed, manufactured and tested in the DNW-TWG wind tunnel at full scale Reynolds number (representative for a front row CROR blade at 75% blade span) and in the appropriate Ma range. One of those airfoils is a reference airfoil (e.g. a NACA0012 or similar), the other airfoil will be specifically designed to represent a CROR blade. The main goal of the project is to create a high quality data base for future high fidelity numerical computation of broadband noise emission."

Although most attention is naturally drawn to the individual application that creates the new business values, a thorough understanding of the underlying infrastructure building blocks, the way these technologies can be used on board transport aircraft, and understanding how these technologies would impact both passenger and cabin crew during flight operations is as important.

This project aims to evaluate the use of immersive technologies such as virtual reality and augmented reality in relation to exponential technologies within a cabin environment, to enable them to be used by passengers and cabin crew during (revenue) flight operation.
 
The fundamental question to be answered in this project is how suitable these immersive technologies are for:
 
1. Increasing well-being of passengers and cabin crew (human factors);
2. Generating ancillary revenue; and
3. Improving operational efficiency.
 
Focus areas within the project are formulated around:

1. Enrichment of the stay of passengers in the cabin space by influencing the field of view.
2. Coordination and cooperation between passenger and cabin crew.
3. Interaction between cabin crew members and cabin crew member with passengers.
4. How the aircraft technology eco-system for hosting exponential technologies inside an aircraft should look like (Architectural point of view)

719500,"Safe and accurate fetal monitoring","2016","2018","During gestation and birth, problems are encountered in up to 15% of all births. Most problems are related to fetal hypoxia and preterm birth. It is estimated that every year over 30.000 babies in Europe suffer from birth asphyxia, despite the common use of monitoring. Recent Norwegian research (2013) revealed inadequate fetal monitoring is responsible for 50% of the cases where human error caused birth asphyxia (oxygen deficiency). It can be concluded that current monitoring technology does not detect vital information on fetal wellbeing, causing unnecessary risks which can eventually lead to fetal mortality. There is thus a clear market need for fetal monitoring technology that is accurate, safe (non-invasive) and easy to use. Nemo Healthcare, a high-tech startup company, is responding to this market need through the development of an innovative electrode patch and hardware/software module that can simultaneously record uterine activity and fetal heart rate. The solution of Nemo is characterized by unique and smart algorithms that can accurately and real-time filter contractions and the fetal heart rate from unprocessed abdominal electrophysiological signals, successfully eliminating noise or interference. The solution will be able to transfer the recorded data wirelessly. The solution will create a breakthrough in the field of fetal monitoring: it will result in better diagnoses, improved quality of care, a reduced number of birth-related problems, increased user friendliness (for medical staff as well as the patient) and lower healthcare cost (through remote monitoring, reduced treatment and avoidance of unnecessary surgery)."

Out of the safety related failures the cardiovascular system is involved in 17% of the preclinical failures and 24% of the clinical failures. Examples of cardiovascular effects, include arrhythmias, hypertrophy, hypertension and reduced ventricular function, which may lead to increased cardiac risk and possibly death. Additional reasons for the decline in success rates are related to the lack of predictive models for early drug efficacy screening. Pluriomics has developed Pluricyte® Cardiomyocytes and integrated proprietary assay systems to overcome the abovementioned challenges. Enabling market uptake and distribution of cell technology based innovations can be challenging, with large scale production and development of regulatory compliant predictive models as main challenges. DeCISIoN will tackle these challenges and thus accelerate market uptake of their cardiac safety assays. DeCISIoN will take the next steps and deliver 1) an up-scaled and more cost-effective manufacturing process; 2) novel, validated, predictive high-throughput cardiac assays for further improved cardiac toxicity and drug efficacy testing and 3) a fully developed marketing and commercialisation strategy for the cardiac assays. As such, DeCISIoN will take Pluriomics' cardiac assays from TRL6 to TRL9."

727597,"Supramolecular hydrogels as local controlled drug delivery carriers","2017","2018","In recent years, macroscale drug delivery systems have been designed and investigated to spatiotemporally control the release of various bioactive agents and drugs at specific locations in the body.  Many of these macroscale drug delivery vehicles are based on hydrogels.  Depending on the location of application, and the temporal release kinetics, these hydrogel drug carriers need to be adjusted to the need of the application. Many of the currently available hydrogel systems do not have the capacity to be totally tuned. These systems: a) display a substantial initial burst release of the drug resulting in high drug doses at the initial phase; b) are difficult to apply (surgical implantation is necessary for various systems, thereby limiting their potential of easy/convenient application); c) provide only limited opportunities for chemical adjustment of their composition to improve key material properties such as their release kinetics and/or degradation rate. SupraCarrier aims to address these unmet needs by developing an injectable, supramolecular ureido-pyrimidinone (UPy) based hydrogel (UPy-hydrogel) drug delivery system that allows for local and sustained drug release. The unique selling points of this UPy-hydrogel system are: a) its demonstrated sustained drug release profile in vitro (with no initial burst release); b) its injectability due to its unique physicochemical properties (that allow for the development of clinical strategies using minimally invasive procedures); and c) its chemical structure and supramolecular assembly behaviour which allows for easy modification of either the UPy-hydrogel carrier or the drug (resulting in a versatile drug delivery platform). With SupraCarrier we aim to a) validate the commercial feasibility of a UPy-hydrogel as a novel local drug delivery system for controlled (and sustained) drug release; b) prioritise the medical applications where this system can be used; and c) provide a proof of concept for using a UPy-hydrogel"
727666,"HYPERTRANS: Transport of hyperpolarized substrates for metabolic MR imaging","2016","2018","Dynamic metabolic imaging with hyperpolarized substrates is a new and unique non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging tool. It opens the window to metabolic aberrations at the heart of many diseases, and the ability to image these changes provides the opportunity to fundamentally improve clinical diagnosis and treatment follow-up. Our long-term ambition is to make hyperpolarized substrates for metabolic imaging with MRI available for every clinical institution. The short-term goal to be reached first, is to make the technique of dynamic metabolic imaging available to the wide scientific community. We will implement a concept in which we can polarize substrates at one central location and store these hyperpolarized substrates for transport and use in other academic institutions. This solution overcomes the current need for an on-site dynamic nuclear polarizer when performing preclinical metabolic imaging with MRI, allows an efficient use of resources, and enables scientific institutions to easily adopt this powerful emerging imaging tool.
Once our proposed concept is proven, and in line with the existing infrastructure and legal license of our institution to manufacture, provide and transport radionuclide tracers to other hospitals, we propose to set up a spin-off company to manufacture, provide and transport hyperpolarized substrates to pre-clinical research institutions. We have currently contacted 11 pre-clinical research sites within transportation distance of our site, of whom 6 have already expressed serious interest in the possibilities of on-demand hyperpolarized substrates. When, in the long run, pre-clinical research has identified and validated the use of dynamic metabolic imaging for use in patients (e.g. in monitoring treatment response in oncology), this company can take the next step to provide hyperpolarized substrates to clinical institutions and general hospitals."

We propose the development of an electrical detector that enables simple, versatile and continuous quality monitoring of these devices and is essential for commercialization. Combined with recent advances in stem cell technology, Organ-on-Chips can be used to do drug screening on an individual level. Therefore it can serve as instrument for personalized medicine, by determining the effectiveness of selected compounds, as well as possible side-effects to determine safe drug doses on a person-specific level. Moreover, Organs-on-Chip will greatly contribute to a further reduction in the need for animal testing. Besides the pharmaceutical industry, Organs-on-Chip hold great promise for the food and cosmetics industry to test the safety of products.

Organ-on-Chip systems need continuous monitoring of the quality of the cell barrier to guarantee reliable outcomes of the drug development tests. State-of-the-art methods, such as fluorescence and commercially available Trans-Endothelial Electrical Resistance (TEER) measurement apparatus are discontinuous, inaccurate and/or harmful for the cells and therefore unsuitable for pharmaceutical applications. Our innovation overcomes these disadvantages. It enables continuous quality monitoring of the barrier function of the organ, which is essential for the commercialization of Organs-on-Chip. The BIOS-Lab on Chip group holds an excellent record in high-quality TEER measurements, demonstrating direct current (DC) TEER-measurements in a gut-on-a-chip in a top-15 of most cited research papers in the journal Lab-on-Chip   in 2015 and has ample experience in the development of a blood-brain barrier on chip.

The future of cancer treatment lies in early and better diagnosis and individually tailored treatments (‘personalised medicine). ptTheragnostic, a company dedicated to the development of more effective, individualised therapies for cancer patients, is working on a breakthrough solution, Radiomics, that is able to revolutionise personalised cancer treatment. Radiomics is a quantitative image analysis technology that enables patient stratification through the use of routinely acquired biomarkers. Being based on the evolution of hundreds of image-derived features over the course of treatment, Radiomics allows for more sensitive and robust identification of tumour types than currently possible. As MRI is recognised as one of the most promising techniques for the detection of cancer and spread of the disease, ptTheragnostic aims to align Radiomics with MRI. Despite the availability of a multi-disciplinary team at ptTheragnostic, they lack the required expertise and skills to implement Radiomics in the MRI market. Therefore, the goal of this project, REACT, is to hire a skilled associate with expertise in MRI and deep learning to establish this implementation. 
During the first 12 months, the associate will be responsible for managing the designed innovation track of Radiomics. This includes both technical and business tasks, amongst aligning the Radiomics software with MRI scanners and drafting a marketing strategy for Radiomics. The associate will follow various trainings in the oncology and business field. REACT may therefore open up new career possibilities in both the business and academic (oncology) field. In addition, REACT, will leverage the growth of ptTheragnostic by enabling Radiomics for MRI resulting in a significant increase in revenues (additional 50% in the first year) and increase in FTE (33%)."

They are known for their recently developed gender screening method, which makes it possible to determine the gender of fertilized breeding eggs halfway through the breeding process. This will prevent the manual sorting of newly hatched chicks and the consequent killing of male chicks in the laying industry. 

When a hatchery implements the gender screening solution, it will no longer kill male chicks after they hatch. Instead. it will take out the male eggs on day nine of incubation. Currently the gender screening solution is being commercialized to suit production of 40,000 eggs per hour. We consider the male eggs to be a high-value resource which should not go to waste. We aim to use the total incubated egg as a natural bio-reactor. By using eggs as a medium for the growth of microorganisms, all sorts of compounds can be produced in a cheap  way.

To achieve this, we are looking for an experienced microbiologist, who has worked with bioreactors and culturing all sorts of microorganisms. Ultimately, we'll set up a bioreactor capable of large scale production of specific proteins. Therefore, the innovation associate should be accustomed to such bioreactors, know how to maintain stable cultures of microorganisms and have experience with the extraction of specific compounds."

The market is growing fast: in 2015 more than 210 eTuks were sold in almost 30 countries, and the eTuks are so successfully exploited in various niches and in various ways. The company’s total volume has grown over 240% over the last 2 years and the 2016 turnover is projected at over 4MEUR, with an EBITDA of over 750kEUR. Recently, TTH has crafted a highly innovative version of the successful 6 year old technology platform. This novel platform “KTX-20” is lighter, more efficient, modular, has a lower TCO, and can host either 4 or 3 wheels. It allows modular sizing and scaling of batteries, and fits the upcoming European and Asian legislation for road vehicle approval. Hence, this platform allows ultimate modular scalability to support a mere endless variation of “L-category” vehicle models and has great potential for upscaling KTX-20 electric cars on a global level.

However, this unlimited freedom represents an inherent risk to invest the limited TTH development budgets in the wrong
business opportunities. Hence, this calls for an in-depth market research to explore the most promising business  applications and related risks in this SME-INSTrument Phase 1 proposal.

703211,"Monitoring changes in brain states using dynamical causal networks","2017","2018","I propose a new model and estimation method that will allow Neuroscientists to detect, track, and predict temporal changes in dynamical brain networks non-invasively. These changes underpin shifts in brain (cognitive) states which are currently inaccessible using standard Neuroimaging techniques. The method combines recent advances in dynamical systems theory and Bayesian inference to integrate Electroencephalography (EEG) and Diffusion Weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DWMRI) data in an efficient way. I will provide a proof of concept that the method can be used as a tool for early diagnosis of brain dysfunction. Given the current emphasis on reducing the social and economic impact of neurodegeneration and aging across the EU, I focus on using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) to induce small changes in two exemplars of distributed networks that simulate semantic and motor neurodegeneration as a demonstration of what this method can detect. The proposed approach has the potential to change strategies for screening and early diagnosis of neurodegenerative conditions. It will lead to new clinical applications that will significantly impact the study of the aging brain and mental health, as well as the analysis of a wide variety of normal brain function, such as social behaviour, decision-making, or resting-state."
704070,"Teneurin interactions in the neuronal synapse","2017","2018","Synapses, connections between neurons, are critical to the formation of neural circuits. Functional neural circuits control intricate processes such as learning and memory, whereas failure in neural circuitry formation can lead to developmental disorders including autism.

At the molecular level, synapse formation is enabled by cell-adhesion molecules that interact across the synapse.  At present, many individual proteins have been identified that contribute to synaptic cell adhesion, but it is unclear how these individual proteins team up in macro-molecular complexes.  I will focus on synaptic cell-adhesion complexes containing Teneurins, a protein family whose essential role in synapse formation has only recently been characterized.

To understand how Teneurin complexes promote synapse formation, I aim to determine the molecular mechanisms that underlie Teneurin1 and Teneurin2 dimerization, including complex formation with their recently identified binding partner Latrophilin.  To achieve this goal, I will determine the structure of Teneurin protein complexes using single particle electron cryo-microscopy.  In parallel, I will study the function of Teneurin complexes in synapse formation using primary hippocampal neurons. Dissecting the molecular mechanisms that underlie Teneurin functions might ultimately advance small molecule therapeutics to treat developmental diseases, including autism.

The work I propose here, draws upon my background in the field of developmental neurobiology, but complements that background with new knowledge and skill sets in structural biology to set me off conducting my own line of research as an independent scientist."

Microscopic imaging  is one of the major drivers of the progress in biomedical and life sciences. The   development of  novel  concepts,  addressing  the  challenges  of  advanced optical microscopy, represents the front line of scientific research.  Modern microscopes are not purely optical devices anymore. They have developed into complex integrated systems, combining  optics, mechanics, electronics, feedback control systems, and image processing Many novel concepts of modern microscopy, while very interesting for research, still have to prove the commercial profitability.  Such developments  can be effectively addressed by  start-up companies with a goal of either custom development,  production and service of these advanced  systems,  or development and selling the IP to a larger player. 
The major goal of this proposal is the creation of the first commercial optical microscope, the performance of which depends completely on the adaptive optics feedback controls. To prove the feasibility of this approach,  we  select a  highly attractive technical concept of adaptive light sheet microscope,  developed in our group in the framework of the ERC project.  In this aspect, our development  relates to ordinary microscope system in the same way as “fly by wire” airplane relates to an  old-fashioned one.

737600,"Pharmacological safety testing in human adult stem cell-derived organoids","2017","2018","Toxicology and pharmacology assays are crucial pillars of modern drug development. They are essential to understand how tissues such as intestine and liver take up and degrade pharmaceutically active compounds. Due to the lack of suitable in vitro systems, these assays are carried out in experimental animals. This practice increases cost and development time but also creates significant ethical issues. 

We recently developed a 3D culture system that allows us to expand human tissue stem cells from intestine and liver as organoids and differentiate them to the respective functional adult tissue in vitro. These stem cell-derived tissues show high cytochrome activity and are able to metabolize drugs in a simple and cost-effective in vitro assay. With support from the ERC Proof of concept grant we aim to prove that our technology can outperform current in vitro systems and replace a significant portion of animal-based toxicology studies. This technological advance will lead to substantial reduction of cost in industrial and academic drug development and overcome practical and ethical pitfalls in animal-based testing.

To this end we will develop an organoid-based assay to test tissue-drug interactions in three steps:

Living, dynamic coatings for medical devices, ie. coatings with proper cell response upon implantation, are attractive for restoring body function. Conventional implant coatings are of inferior quality and therefore the majority, if not all, biocoatings fail in suitably interacting with host tissue. This poor performance of existing biocoating technologies is mostly caused by inherently static properties of surface coating, which disturbs the inherently dynamics between cells and surroundings, disrupting healthy tissue response and eventually causing adverse reactions like infections. Living coatings are produced by an innovative one step pre-conditioning of FDA approved polymeric and metal surfaces. Living non-pathogenic bacteria with GRAS status are suitable for in-vivo use, which provide medical devices with dynamic and responsive characteristics. 

Dynamic IMPLANTaLive coatings provide bidirectionality, ie. the ability to process biological stimuli by cellular control feedback loops and hence influence cellular and tissue characteristics and responses. This greatly enhances the application potential as the living coating can be easily tailored to the specific needs of a patient. IMPLANTaLive coatings can actively stimulate the reconstruction or injured site by releasing specific growth factors (relevant for ligament and tendon repair) or express membrane bound endothelial cell specific adhesion proteins (relevant for vascular devices). 

A business case will be developed for IMPLANTaLive covering different markets and routes for market introduction. Results of market analysis and financing needs will be combined with science-based technology comparison and used for discussions with potential industry partners.

The company’s strength has traditionally lied in electronic structure methods, its flagship product being the well-known ADF package. In recent years SCM has been broadening its scope to add approximate, faster methods. One of such methods is ReaxFF, arguably the most transferable reactive empirical force field method and the computational method of choice for atomistic-scale dynamical simulations of chemical reactions.
The addition of ReaxFF to our portfolio is a response to market demand, as materials modellers increasingly require accurate simulations of systems involving up to millions of atoms. ReaxFF is a key component of SCM’s medium and long-term strategy, being its module with the fastest-growing demand (and providing over 160% growth in revenues in the last two years.).
However, meeting that demand will require important developments, extending ReaxFF to drastically longer time scales in order to achieve large time and length scales with high-accuracy atomistic resolution, currently a major bottleneck for industrial modellers. Such an extension will reduce the need for supercomputing resources and will require the implementation of acceleration techniques, coupling molecular dynamics and statistical mechanics models. This is highly specialized work that falls outside SCM’s strengths in electronic structure methods, and the company needs to recruit skills combining expertise in a range of molecular modelling schemes as well as modern software development techniques.
Such an extended ReaxFF would lower the barrier for manufacturing companies to use modelling as a means to becoming more competitive, extending the market for SCM’s ReaxFF implementation and further driving growth.

739763,"INNOvative mapping, reporting and forecasting of CYANObacteria blooms applying the synergistic use of advanced in situ optical data, satellite imagery and statistical modelling","2017","2018","Water Insight (WI) specialises in high quality spatial information products for monitoring surface water quality applying the synergistic use of Earth Observation (EO) and optical in situ measurements. Based on a close interaction with users, WI wants to add a new user-tailored service branch to their portfolio: forecasting of cyanobacteria blooms.
Due to climate change and anthropogenic activity, massive blooms of cyanobacteria become an increasing problem for lakes world-wide. Cyanobacteria may be toxic for animals and humans, change the water quality and ecosystems. The consequences are visible in social, economic and industrial levels. While WI's technology has been proven to be very suitable for monitoring the development of cyanobacteria blooms, water managers also require quick and precise forecasts of the blooms development to take timely measures or mitigating actions. Existing process-based forecasting models are complex, need a too long processing time and more input data than is operationally available. 
WI has an extensive dataset of EO and in situ data on affected lakes. A data-driven statistical model could be developed based on these data, and significantly reduce the processing time for a forecast. To develop such a model, a highly-skilled searcher (PhD) is required, with specialised knowledge of EO data, proven skills in statistical modelling, cyanobacterial ecology and water quality. It is difficult for WI to recruit such a specialist as there is a lack of university graduates, particularly on the PhD level, in this field in the Netherlands.
INNO-CYANO will be beneficial for all: WI will get the chance to hire a specialist to develop our innovative ideas, the candidate will get the chance to get an insight in the practice of a commercial company and to develop in the field of business innovation, and the ‘INNO-CYANO’ model will serve water managers with a precise forecast of the blooms and therefore improve the management of cyanobacteria blooms."
739793,"Humanitarian Optimization through Research by Argusi – Envisioning Shorter Times of delivery","2017","2018","Argusi is a research driven SME that possesses deep knowledge about supply chain optimization and collaboration in mainly the commercial sector. Argusi’s expertise focuses on designing optimal supply networks in terms of minimized cost or time-to-consumer by using state of the art modelling tools and techniques. With the branch Argusi Aid, Argusi aims to explore a new market opportunity by transferring knowledge and technical models from the commercial sector to the humanitarian sector, while at the same time making a contribution to a better world. To be able to develop Argusi Aid to its full potential, knowledge of and experience from both commercial sector and humanitarian sector supply chains is needed. Besides Argusi’s strong knowledge of supply chain design, optimization and collaboration, specific knowledge is required on the highly uncertain and variable demand, the challenging distribution networks, the influence of donors as an additional supply chain party, and the difference between emergency response and development supply chains. Cultural and regional knowledge is needed for knowing the right way of transferring knowledge and technical models taking into account country and sector specific factors. This knowledge needs to be combined to research and develop an overview of differences and similarities between commercial, emergency response and development supply chains, a visual insight in global supply chain flows and current (in)efficiencies finding synergies between NGO supply chains and technical supply chain models for the different humanitarian supply chains (emergency response and development supply chains) taking into account the uncertainties and additional actor. An internal and external training package and a long term business plan also have to be developed. Knowledge training in Argusi’s topics of expertise and software and skills training in e.g. project management, leadership skills and developing business plans will be provided."
739831,"Automation of Correlative Optical Tweezers-Fluorescence Microscopy Experiments","2017","2018","LUMICKS is a recent spin-off from the VU University in Amsterdam, bringing to market a revolutionary technology which makes it possible to visualize DNA-protein interactions at the single-molecule level in real time, which is key to e.g. cancer research. 

In order to make the step from the biophysics market, which LUMICKS currently serves, towards the biology market a great part of the experimental proceedings need to be automated. Entering the biology market will be a great step for both LUMICKS and the single-molecule research world, as this will enable a greater group of researcher to work on single-molecule biology and discover the building blocks of life.

For automating the experimental process LUMICKS seeks to hire a Technology Development Engineer which leads the project and develops working prototypes. The 12-months period will be set-up in such a way that the associate is completely informed about LUMICKS' technology and has followed the first trainings on how to successfully handle the project within two months. The project is built-up from multiple work packages: onboarding and training, automate in-situ assay assembly, automate calibration, automate alignment, automate experiments and automate error detection. During this period more tailored trainings will be provided to prepare the associate for the non-academic world.

Similar vacancies have proven to be impossible to fill by Dutch scientists, since people with the required profile are scarce, due to the unique set of abilities necessary for the tasks, and recourses within start-ups are relatively low (and salaries relatively high) in the Netherlands. Therefore, recruitment should be done to people outside the Netherlands. 

All this makes the SME Innovation Associate grant a unique opportunity for LUMICKS to make the next step in our innovation strategy and for the associate to make the step from an academic towards a more commercial environment."
751761,"A pharmacogenomic exploration of adverse drug reactions in epilepsy","2017","2018","Epilepsy is a common disease characterized by recurrent seizures affecting 50 million people worldwide. For most people with epilepsy, long term treatment with antiepilepileptic drugs (AEDs) are necessary and 40% do not respond to the first line of AED, leading to a lifelong odyssey towards effective treatment. Diagnosis is the only predictor of which drug will work best however it is a poor predictor and there is a need for improved biomarkers. AEDs carry a considerable risk for adverse drug reactions (ADRs). ADRs can be minimized by careful titration towards therapeutic dose however idiosyncratic ADRs, particularly cutaneous adverse reactions, have been shown to have a genetic predisposition. However, despite the relative success of GWAS to identify predictors of hypersensitivity there are few other predictors of some more common ADRs. The applicant is aligned with large international consortia such as EpiPGX, the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) Complex Genetics Consortium and the the Canadian Pharmacogenetic Network for Drug Safety (CPNDS) who have amassed a collection of over 15,000 epilepsy cases with phenotype and genotype data. Further, over 2000 samples have whole exome sequence data available. This has provided a medium to investigate the genetic architecture of ADRs and a resource to replicate novel significant findings. This fellowship proposes to move beyond traditional GWAS into new territory for epilepsy pharmacogenomics by exploring the contribution of polygenic risk and rare variants. The aim of this fellowship proposal is to identify clinically useful genetic markers of adverse reactions to AEDs to the growing number of prognostic tests for clinicians to prescribe optimal treatment targeted to each individual patient and improve medication safety in epilepsy."
754481,"Quantum Detectors","2017","2018","In HANAS (Hybrid Artificial and Natural Atomic Systems) storage in atomic quantum memories of single photons generated with novel quantum dot devices was demonstrated.  Single photon detectors are crucial building blocks in quantum memories and in follow-up technologies such as quantum repeaters and the quantum internet. For our experiments in HANAS, single photon detectors based on semiconducting avalanche photodiodes were first used until a new type of single photon detectors based on superconducting nanostructures, originally developed for telecom wavelengths, was tested and greatly outperformed other detectors. This innovative detector makes complex quantum optics experiments far easier and faster to perform. In Qdet, we will develop and fully benchmark a prototype based on these superconducting quantum detectors optimized for atomic frequencies and start the commercialization process with an industrial partner. We will establish superconducting single photon detectors as the best systems for single photon detection in the near infrared, combining the highest detection efficiency, time resolution and lowest noise levels. A market research study and contacts with key players in the field will enable us to identify launching customers and benchmark our systems for demanding applications in a new wavelength range."
755471,"Therapeutic antibody drug monitoring using bioluminescent sensors proteins and a smartphone","2017","2018","Therapeutic antibodies represent an important class of newly introduced drugs and have been particularly successful in cancer therapy and the treatment of inflammatory diseases. The clearance rates of therapeutic antibodies are known to differ per individual and correlate with survival rates. Being able to define a personalized dose per patient based on continuous monitoring of therapeutic antibody levels would therefore be beneficial both for the individual patient and for the hospital’s budget. Our group recently developed a new platform of bioluminescent sensor proteins for antibody detection that allow antibody detection directly in blood plasma using the camera of a smart phone as the sole piece of equipment. 

The goal of this ERC Proof-of-Concept is to establish LUMABS as a unique, low cost, and easily accessible point-of-care technology for monitoring therapeutic antibodies. 

To enable clinical and commercial translation a product portfolio will be established that includes the development and validation of a prototype point-of-care assay for the therapeutic antibody Cetuximab. To establish LUMABS as a broadly applicable platform technology, we will use recently developed epitope screening technology to develop specific LUMABS sensors targeting Infliximab and biosimilar antibodies that are used to treat inflammatory conditions such as Crohns’ disease and rheumatoid arthritis. Based on an in-depth market analysis and the feedback we receive from external stakeholders on the performance of our technology, a realistic strategy will be developed for further translation and commercialization. During the project we will continuously assess opportunities for new patent applications. Our IP strategy will be guided by the outcome of our market examination and analysis of the most interesting business opportunities."
756049,"High Speed, Cost Effective Optical Communications Module Enabling the Next Generation of Ethernet 400 GbE","2016","2018","Project “RocketChip” will develop a 400 Gb/s optical communications module for optical fibre transmission. The core technology for this high speed, communications module is Photonic Integrated Circuits (PIC). This technology allows the transmit- and receive-functionality of the system to be integrated onto single chips. The size of the integrated chips will allow the module size to meet the requirement of an industry standard common form factor. This will make it physically compatible with current system vendors’ products.

In the North of the Netherlands around 3000 companies have received a NIOF grant, which is a grant for innovative companies. Therefore, it can be said that the innovating potential of companies in the North of the Netherlands is rather high. However, this potential is not optimally exploited. Therefore, EEN NN wants to assist the SMEs in the North of the Netherlands with their innovation management. 
First of all, EEN NN will establish Key Account Management for the beneficiaries of the SME Instrument in the North of the Netherlands. This service includes the identification of weaknesses in innovation capacities, find suitable coaches for the relevant SME and accompany the SME through the SME Instrument project. 
Secondly, EEN NN will provide new EEN services for the enhancement of the innovation capacity of SMEs in the North of the Netherlands. This includes the assessment of the current status of the innovation management capacity of the beneficiary and consequently performing a needs/gaps analysis and development of an action plan to increase the SMEs innovation management capacities. This action plan will be implemented and EEN NN will initiate and guide next appropriate steps.
The objective for EEN NN is to assist at least twenty SMEs from the North of the Netherlands region with these services. We expect to deliver the KAM services to five SMEs and the EIMC services to fifteen companies."
782875,"Inkless by Tocano – Printing without consumables","2017","2018","Current printers use ink as a consumable resulting in high operational costs and the production of approximately 2.3 Billion litres of environmentally unfriendly chemicals per year. 

The main objective of the overall innovation project is to provide a solution for inkless printing. The production, replacement, and refilling of cartridges/toners itself also have significant effects on the environment, due to the chemicals that are used, the production process (electricity, logistics, etc.) and the disposal of empty cartridges/toners through landfilling. Another concern is the release of dust and ozonisation during operation, which causes health problems and air pollution. 

The innovative solution of Tocano B.V. provides an inkless printing technology that will overcome these issues. As a result the European environment will strongly benefits as CO2 emission is reduced up to 65 kton/year. The proposed valorisation of Tocano’s solution represents a potential total value increase for the European economy of approximately EUR 6 Billion/year. 

The long term ambition of Tocano is to achieve a market share of 10% in the monochromatic printing market. This is a significant step towards a sustainable and cost competitive printing industry. In this feasibility assessment the final hurdles will be taken towards a market introduction supported by a convincing demonstration of the inkless printing technology in an operational environment throughout Europe."
